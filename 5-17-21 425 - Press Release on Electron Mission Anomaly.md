### Notes

- **Electron Mission Update**:
    - On **May 15, 2021**, Rocket Lab’s **20th Electron mission** experienced an anomaly during the second-stage ignition, leading to the loss of the mission’s payload for **BlackSky**.
    - Preliminary analysis indicates an engine computer detected an issue and performed a safe shutdown.
    - Despite the anomaly, the vehicle remained within safety limits, and the first stage performed nominally.
- **Recovery Milestones**:
    - The mission marked a significant step in Rocket Lab’s **reusability program**, with the first stage successfully splashing down under parachutes and being retrieved for analysis.
    - The new heat shield successfully protected the stage during reentry, and recovered components are suitable for reuse in future missions.
- **CEO Statement**:
    - **Peter Beck**, CEO of Rocket Lab, expressed regret over the payload loss but reaffirmed confidence in a swift return to flight. He emphasized the continued progress in recovery and reusability efforts.
- **Merger Progress**:
    - Rocket Lab and **Vector Acquisition Corporation** confidentially submitted an **S-4 Registration Statement** to the SEC on May 7, 2021. The merger is expected to facilitate Rocket Lab’s public listing on Nasdaq as **RKLB**.
