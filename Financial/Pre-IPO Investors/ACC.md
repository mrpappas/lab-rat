The **Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC)** is a New Zealand Crown entity responsible for administering the country's no-fault accidental injury compensation scheme. Established in 1974, ACC provides financial compensation and support to citizens, residents, and temporary visitors who suffer personal injuries. The scheme covers a wide range of injuries, including those sustained at work, home, or during recreational activities, regardless of who is at fault. Funded through levies on employers, employees, and motor vehicle owners, as well as government contributions, ACC aims to reduce the personal and financial impact of injuries by covering medical costs, rehabilitation, and, in some cases, income replacement.
