### Peter Beck: 
Thanks, Marielle and thanks for everybody joining us today. Look, 2024 was our biggest revenue year ever and I’m proud to share that we delivered very strong results for Q4 twenty twenty four and indeed for the full year. We achieved our highest annual revenue figure to date of AUD $436,000,000, that’s more than 78% increase on previous year’s revenue, demonstrating that our strategy of delivering end to end space services is paying off and delivering significant growth. From Q3 to Q4 last year, we saw growth of more than 26% and year on year Q4 growth was 121%. Something you’ll hear me say often at Rocket Lab is we do what we say we’re going to do and in this case that’s delivering significant growth, 382% increase in Q4 revenue to be precise since our entry into the NASDAQ in 2021.

On the launch side, these figures are driven by an increase of [[Electron]] launch cadence and the introduction of hypersonic suborbital test launch capabilities. Space Systems contribution has been continued strong execution across both spacecraft and constellation build and operation as well as our merchant satellite component businesses. Now let’s dig into these areas in a little bit more detail in the following slides. Our accomplishments in 2024 really speak for those record numbers. On the launch front we delivered a record number of 16 launches spanning [[Electron]] and [[HASTE]] all with 100% mission success. Once again we have maintained our position as the leading small launch provider globally and the second most frequently launched U. S. Rocket annually. We signed more than $450,000,000 in new contracts in 2024 across launch and space systems, further strengthening our backlog which currently sits at just over $1,000,000,000 We also achieved a world first by successfully launching two missions within twenty four hours from pads on either side of the planet. On the space systems front, there are too many achievements to distill into one slide so here are just a couple of my favorites. We made significant progress on the design and build of the 40 plus spacecraft in our backlog but I’m particularly proud of the team completing the manufacture and test of the twin spacecraft for [[NASA]]’s escapade mission to Mars. They did this on an impressively short timeframe and an incredibly cost competitive for an interplanetary mission.

While they’re yet to launch, we are excited to see these birds on their way to the Red Planet soon. Our reentry to [[Varda Space Industries|Varda]] was another major milestone successfully enabling the first in space manufacturing mission outside the International Space Station. Since first reentry early last year, we’ve delivered two more Pioneer spacecraft for [[Varda Space Industries|Varda]] with the second returning to earth in South Australia. Another third Pioneer spacecraft for [[Varda Space Industries|Varda]] is just now days away from launch. That’s just a tiny snapshot of our achievements in 2024, but before we dig deeper into the updates across Electron, Neutron and Space Systems, I want to provide an overview of our strategic focus for this year.

We’re building a truly end to end space company, that means owning the full value chain of having the keys to unlock enormous potential from the rapidly growing space economy. The first two steps are well underway with launch in space systems meaning that we have our own ride to space and we can build and operate the satellites on orbit. The final remaining step is space applications or delivering data or services from space using our own constellation. In 2024, we made significant progress across all three and we’re building on that again in 2025. On the launch front, this year is the year of Neutron.

We look forward to unlocking the medium launch bottleneck by bringing Neutron to the pad to help launch and more than estimated 10,000 Constellation spacecraft that need deployment in the coming decade. We’re continuing to wrap up our small launch cadence with more than 20 missions in 2025 on the manifest across Electron and [[HASTE]]. Of course as usual these missions only launch when our customers are ready. It’s worth pointing out that as far as I’m aware Rocket Lab is the only launch provider with missions scheduled this year across small launch, medium launch, hypersonic suborbital test launch. This demonstrates the breadth of our launch experience and capabilities and also positions us to take advantage of the TAM exposure across several different growing launch markets.

On the space systems front, we have more than 40 spacecraft in various stages of production right now. By the end of summer this year we expect to have more than quadruple the number of Rocket Lab spacecraft on orbit ready to launch or have completed their missions. I’m also excited to reveal a new addition to our spacecraft line up, one that slots nicely into our vision for space applications and I’ll talk more about this satellite later in the call. But first, so now for some updates on [[Electron]]. Twenty twenty four was a fantastic year for [[Electron]].

Last year we increased our launch cadence 60% year on year and 2025 is shaping up to be even bigger. We’ve launched twice this year already both times for satellite constellation operators and each with only ten days of each other within ten days of each other. Last year’s trend was building out satellite constellations with [[Electron]]. In Q1 twenty twenty five this has continued with launches for constellation operators [[BlackSky]] and [[Kinéis]], both of whom have booked multiple missions on [[Electron]] to deploy or replenish their constellations. [[Kinéis]] in particular is worth calling out since we launched them for the first time in June as part of a five launch deal.

We’re now four launches in and on track to complete their fifth launch shortly meaning that we will have deployed their full constellation of 25 satellites in less than a year. And to put that into perspective, many constellation operators can wait for a year for their first launch with other providers. Last year we also signed a multi launch deal with the Japanese earth imaging company IQPS for four electrons and then just this month they signed another agreement to double that and lock in eight [[Electron]] launches for their constellation deployment over 2025 and 2026. In 2024 we built on our success in the small launch market with [[Electron]]’s suborbital variant, [[HASTE]]. Last year’s Pentagon budget request for hypersonic research was up 46% to US6.9 billion dollars on the two years prior and we’re ideally positioned to support this expanding market.

We’re the only commercial provider that’s executed two launches in twenty one days for the Department of Defense, MACH TB program, which we completed in Q4 and we have another five [[HASTE]] missions locked in for the DoD and its contractors. In January we also announced that we’ve been selected by Kratos to support the next phase of the March MACH TB program called MARC TB two point zero. It’s a 1,450,000,000 five year contract to expand hypersonic technology testing and with [[HASTE]] we’re uniquely suited to meet that challenge. I think it’s also important to place all of that within the wider context of today’s geopolitics and America’s defense technology. Hypersonics have become increasingly urgent under the new administration.

In the words of the President, within the executive order he issued in January to build the Iron Dome for America, the threat of hypersonic and other advanced aerial attacks is the most serious threat facing The United States today. Furthering peace whose strength is critical to America’s defense, our capabilities with [[HASTE]], our affordability and our speed, all of which are the new administration’s top priorities, makes it a great product fit to address these challenges. Right, moving on from small launch into Neutron updates. Well, the title really here sees it all. This is the year of Neutron monopoly breaker to unlock the bottleneck of medium launch.

As I said before, there’s more than 10,000 satellites that need launch in the next five years from commercial constellations alone and then there’s the growing demand from national security and defense missions as well as interplanetary exploration for the science community and it goes on. The need is clear so I won’t labor on it other than to say that the industry is crying out for more launch options in this class and Neutron is coming to market in record time to deliver it. Neutron is also critical to us launching and operating our own future satellite constellation. So over the next few slides I’ll take you through the latest development milestones and achievements as we work to get Neutron on the pad in the second half of this year. Okay, so at LC3 all major hardware and infrastructure items have arrived and been installed and our civil works on the site are practically finished.

Yes, and we even have water. Most recent updates include the FLIR stack, 165 ton steel circular launch mount structure that Neutron will launch from, giant pair of LNG tanks, the ones you can see in the bottom left of the slides. Those are the heaviest objects to have ever crossed the Wallops Island Bridge, and their installation marks the completion of all the long lead propellant storage for the launch site. What’s left now is to complete the electrical and mechanical connections for a fully integrated system, but otherwise we look forward to its grand opening in a few short months. Now on to the one of the most exciting and novel features of Neutron, its hungry hippo faring.

The massive reusable nose cone halves are now live and moving, fully integrated with their avionics and actuators and all of the mechanical systems. We’re testing like we’re flying, opening and closing the hungry hippo at full speed to understand exactly how they behave and it’s great to say I was there in person for the first slot of testing and I can tell you that it’s a wonderful sound to hear the hungry hippo in action and I fully encourage you to go and check out the video we’ll put out today of all of that testing in action, it’s pretty cool. We have a few more run throughs as we add some hardware, then they’ll soon be making their way over to our assembly and integration facilities ready to be fitted to Neutron’s first stage for launch.

Let me draw you a to the picture on the top left, that’s our stage one tank stacked and ready to ship out. Check out the person at the bottom of the frame and for scale and you can see the size of that tank. All of the launch vehicle is currently in production with significant parts of it currently in test before being shipped out to the launch site for integration. We are even moving past Flight one with structures including fairing halves already in production for our second Neutron rocket. For Flight one though, all of Neutron’s largest pieces will soon be moving across the country and making their way to the East Coast.

They’ll be integrated with all the avionics and software and it’ll go with the fit checks and AIT before going straight into full system qualification. So keep an eye out for pictures of tanks and barges to know where we’re getting closer to that next milestone. Now on to Archimedes, the engines qualification campaign continues at a cracking pace We’re hot firing every few days and the testing is going well. We’ve got engines consistently moving across the country between the production line in Long Beach and the engine test site in Mississippi. You also may have seen we shared a recent update that performance iterations on the production line have resulted more than a couple of hundred kilograms shed from the engine which is always good.

And also check out the size of that second stage nozzle expansion cone in the bottom left of the slide that were recently produced and on its way for testing. It’s a cool thing. Okay. So from engine testing, we’re really doubling down on our test cadence to match with the increased production rate out of Long Beach. So we’re running a really intensifying test campaign on multiple engines as we lead up to Flight one.

So in that case, the build of a second Archimedes engine test cell is nearly complete and This enables us to concurrently test engines as our investments in production ramp up. So having two cells is always good. Now we’ve provided plenty of updates on where Neutron will lift off but not much where it will land. Well, here she is, meet return on investment, we named that specifically for Adam Spice. Neutron’s four hundred foot ocean land platform, that’s what we see on the screen there, The image at the bottom of the left also providing a great sense of scale how big this vessel actually is.

Alongside shore based landing sites and the ocean platform gives us the flexibility to maximize the vehicle’s performance by allowing us to dedicate less propellant to landing and more to lifting our customers payloads to diverse and complex orbits. With the vessel secured, work has now begun on modifying it, we’re adding autonomous ground support equipment that secures Neutron to the deck when it lands, heat shielding, propulsive systems and things to keep it on target for Neutron’s return. The landing platform is also a clear indication that we’re scaling up and moving past first minimum viable product with Neutron now. With one launch set for ’25, we’re aiming to triple that in ’26 and then the landing barge is obviously critical to that ramp up. Now recovery isn’t planned on the barge for the first test flight, we’ll be doing a soft splashdown, but we can expect return on investment to live up its name in ’twenty six when it enters service for all the future Neutron flights.

Now the road to launch. I’m often asked what should we look at to indicate Neutron’s progress to the pad because there’s just so much going on. So we tried to create a little bit of a visual overview here of the big ticket items that we’re running concurrently right now and what’s left to go to get to the pad. We’ve always been clear that we run aggressive schedules and that gets us to the pad on a rapid timeframe. But of course nobody wants to get the rocket faster to pad than I do.

The important thing to point out here is that these tasks are not serial. We don’t wait to finish one before starting the next. Everything has been worked on concurrently and some of them are long pieces, long lead pieces that might come together just days before the launch, for example a launch license. This is an air force radio as everyone knows, we’re no strangers to bringing in a new rocket to market. We’re running aggressive schedules as we always do.

At the end of the day, as I’ve always said, it’s --

>Conference Call was cut off briefly

### Kelvin, Conference Operator: 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize, but there will be a slight delay in today’s conference.


### Peter Beck: 
Uh-huh. Sorry that everyone. I’m not sure why the line dropped there. But I’ll reiterate the previous slide just to make sure that everybody got it. So I’m often asked what we should look for and to indicate Neutron’s progress to the pad. So we’ve created a visual overview here of the big ticket items that we’re running concurrently right now and what is left to go to get us to the pad and flight this year.

We’ve always been really clear that we run aggressive schedules and that gets us to the pad quickly and of course I want to get to the pad faster than anybody else. The important thing to point out here is all these tasks are not serial. We don’t wait to finish one before starting the next. Everything has been worked concurrently and some of them are long lead pieces that come together literally days before the launch, for example a launch license. And now of course this isn’t our first rodeo and we’re no strangers to bringing a new rocket to the pad.

We run aggressive schedules and at the end of the day as I always say it’s a rocket program but right now we’re planning for first launch in the second half of this year. I’m very happy with the progress of the development program. Neutron is going to be a really important vehicle for the industry and we’re excited to see to be the ones delivering that. So moving on from launch now and to provide some updates on our space systems businesses. I’m happy to share mission success for our latest spacecraft [[Varda Space Industries|Varda]].

In the early hours of this morning and I mean early, our Pioneer spacecraft flawlessly executed an earth reentry maneuver and deployed [[Varda Space Industries|Varda]]’s capsule to land in South Australia. The mission was launched in January and had been operating on orbit for over a month delivering critical mission functions for [[Varda Space Industries|Varda's]] capsule. We have our third Pioneer class satellite with its [[Varda Space Industries|Varda's]] capsule ready and waiting for launch in the coming days which is the second satellite ready for launch of this program within a month. For our Space Systems team, they’re busy right now helping land a [[NASA]] lunar lander mission on the moon. After its forty five day journey through space, our very own space grade solar cells have provided over fourteen hundred operational hours of power for this mission, while the space software team have been providing 20 fourseven support for the orbit control and engine burns that have gotten this apart.

They’ll be continuing that support for the mission right through its most critical phases too including landing on the moon itself. On the national defense side, our team is really hitting their stride with two critical programs. We’re now deep into the detailed design phase of our $500,000,000 prime contract with the [[Space Development Agency (SDA)]]. Early last month we cleared a critical step of the program, the first design review that ensures our satellites and how they operate all meet the rigorous mission requirements set down by the US Department of Defense. All 18 satellites use practically every one of their integrated subsystems and components including solar panels, composite structures, star trackers, reaction wheels, radios, flight, ground software, avionics, launch dispensers and so on and so forth.

It’s a high level control over our own products within our own prime programs that gives us the ability to deliver world class national defense solutions with certainty on cost and schedule and of course quality. We also have our twenty four hour notice responsive space mission coming up this year for the U. S. Space Force. This one is a $32,000,000 Victor Hays (LON:HAYS) mission with a Rocket Lab satellite launching on a Rocket Lab [[Electron]] on short notice to demonstrate that we can respond to threats on very short timelines.

In the defense industry that’s called tactical responsive space. It’s a hugely complex yet sought after capability that the Pentagon is eager to have on hand with trusted commercial partners. With their proven capabilities across space systems and launch, it’s a position we’re uniquely suited for. Now most of those missions employ spacecraft from our line up of standard standard vertically integrated satellites that we announced last year. But today I’m excited to share a big announcement.

Please meet Flatellite, a low cost mass producible satellite tailored for large constellations. Now we’ve developed Flatellite after many years of working closely with constellation operators and getting to deeply understand their needs of today and of course into the future. Flatellite is a scalable resilient high power satellite that can enable capabilities such as secure low latency high speed connectivity and remote sensing for national security, defense and commercial markets. With Flatellite we can do something few spacecraft manufacturers can. We can build it fast, cost effectively and in high volumes thanks to our experience in spacecraft production combined with deep vertical integration of our in house components.

This puts us in greater control of cost and schedule than others relying on constrained supply chains. What’s more, once we’ve built them we can launch the ourselves too, that’s thanks to its low profile stackable design we can maximize the number of Flatellite launched per mission, ensuring seamless integration with Neutron. The bottom far right render with Flatellite stacked inside Neutron’s fairings gives you a bit of an idea of the scale here. Now the flat light is more than just a new product development to serve our customers’ ever evolving needs though. It’s a bold, strategic move towards completing the final step of Rocket Lab’s ultimate vision of truly becoming an end to end space company and operating its own constellation and delivering services from space.

By having our own ride to space with Neutron and [[Electron]], and being able to build our own spacecraft in high volumes, we are at a distinct advantage when it comes to establishing constellations with speed and cost efficiency. That’s about all we can share on Flatellite today, but I’m excited to be able to share more with you soon on this, so watch this space. So with that, I’ll hand it over to Adam now to provide further commentary and to discuss our financial highlights and outlook. 

### Adam Spice: 
Thanks Pete. Fourth quarter twenty twenty four revenue was $132,000,000 which was above the midpoint of our prior guidance range and reflects significant year over year growth of 121% driven by strong contribution from both business segments but led by Space Systems. Fourth quarter revenue represented a sequential increase of 26.3% primarily due to the increase in launches from 3% to 5% including two [[HASTE]] missions during the quarter which come at a higher ASP versus standard electron missions. On a full year basis 2024 revenue was $436,000,000 an impressive growth of approximately 78% year on year. Our Launch Services segment delivered revenue of $42,400,000 and our current [[Electron]] and [[HASTE]] backlog continues to support an increasing ASP with some quarterly variability tied to volume purchase commitments, launch location and mission assurance requirements.

On a full year basis, Launch delivered revenue of $125,400,000 which is an increase of roughly 74% year on year. Our Space Systems segment delivered $90,000,000 in the quarter, reflecting sequential growth of over 7% driven primarily by a strong quarter from satellite manufacturing and our attitude direction and control subsystems business. On a full year basis, Space Systems delivered revenue of $310,800,000 or an increase of 80% year on year. Now turning to gross margin. GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 27.8% at the high end of our prior guidance range of 26% to 28%.

Non GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34%, which was also at the end of our prior guidance range of 32% to 34%. On a full year basis, GAAP gross margin was 26.6% while non GAAP gross margin was 32%. Although gross margins in our launch business can be volatile quarter to quarter dependent upon customer mix and mission type, In 2025, we expect continued margin expansion in both segments as [[Electron]]’s cadence continues to increase at higher ASPs and our Space Systems business continues to scale. Relatedly, we ended Q4 with production related headcount of 1,004 heads, up 40 from the prior quarter. Turning to backlog, we ended Q4 twenty twenty four with $1,070,000,000 of total backlog with launch backlog of $386,000,000 and space systems backlog of $681,000,000 While year on year backlog growth was modest at approximately 2%, this should be put in the context of increasing lumpiness of backlog additions given the timing of increasingly larger needle moving deals and customer program opportunities.

Sequentially, there was a slight remixing of our backlog as a result of particularly strong bookings in our launch segment, which we expect to continue as we convert our pipeline of Neutron opportunities. At first glance, our backlog has roughly a fifty fifty split between government and commercial. But as you dig deeper, many of our commercial customers ultimately cater to the needs of U. S. Government and other friendly nations.

We view this as a significant advantage, especially in evolving political and budgetary environments as government’s focus on space and efficiency remains a high priority. We continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline including multi launch deals and large satellite manufacturing contracts that as mentioned earlier can create lumpiness in backlog growth given the size and complexity of these opportunities. We expect approximately 50% of current backlog to be recognized as revenues within twelve months. Turning to operating expenses in the quarter. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of twenty twenty four were $88,400,000 modestly above our guidance range of $84,000,000 to $86,000,000 Non GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $74,500,000 just below our guidance range of $75,000,000 to $77,000,000 GAAP operating expenses grew 39% from the prior quarter’s prior year fourth quarter, almost entirely related to a step up in Neutron spending, particularly Archimedes testing, investments in composite structures development and IT related spending, including a step up in cybersecurity requirements related to our U.S. Government programs. Non GAAP operating expenses also grew 39% year on year, largely due to the same reasons as our GAAP OpEx increases, less the effect of stock based compensation expenses and non recurring transaction costs. Now focusing on quarter over quarter changes. The sequential increases in both GAAP and non GAAP operating expenses were primarily driven by continued growth in headcount and prototype spending to support our Neutron development program and related IT infrastructure and IT support for both Neutron and our SDA satellite contract.

In R and D specifically, GAAP expenses increased $532,000 quarter on quarter due to Neutron prototyping materials and headcount growth. Non GAAP R and D expenses were up $3,300,000 quarter on quarter more than the GAAP increase due to fluctuations in non cash stock based compensation between R and D and cost of sales related to the EAC accounting of our space systems manufacturing programs. As such, the non GAAP R and D increase of $3,300,000 represents well the underlying trend in core R and D spend in the business, again driven largely by investments in Neutron. Q4 ending R and D headcount was $8.28, representing an increase of 52 for the prior quarter. In SG and A, GAAP expenses increased $7,900,000 quarter on quarter largely due to an increase in outside services related to IT, legal and finance with IT spend largely related to security and cyber security requirements under our SDA contract, legal spend supporting a range of corporate initiatives including corporate development and year end audit activities which are paired with an increase in staff costs.

With that GAAP spend, we reported non recurring transaction costs of $2,200,000 in Q4, owing to a step up in corporate development activities, including advancing a robust pipeline of M and A opportunities. Non GAAP SG and A expenses increased by $2,500,000 driven by the previously mentioned GAAP increases. Q4 ending SG and A headcount was three twenty nine, representing an increase of 29 from the prior quarter. In summary, total fourth quarter headcount was 2,161 up 121 heads from the prior quarter. Turning to cash, purchases of property equipment and capitalized software licenses were $21,500,000 in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty four, an increase of $10,500,000 from the $11,000,000 in the third quarter of twenty twenty four.

As we continue to invest in Neutron research, testing and scaling production, we expect increased capital expenditures to continue for the next few quarters. Cash consumed from operations was $2,400,000 in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty four compared to $30,900,000 in the third quarter of twenty twenty four. The sequential improvement of $28,500,000 was driven primarily by the increased Space Systems programs milestone receipts, which can be lumpy. Overall, non GAAP free cash flow defined as GAAP operating cash flow less purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty four was a use of $23,900,000 compared to $41,900,000 in the third quarter of twenty twenty four. We do expect a pickup in cash consumption in Q1 owing to an expected increase in Neutron spending ahead of our twenty twenty five launch and the lumpiness in large contract driven space systems milestone collections, which are projected to be lower in Q1 off a strong Q4 combined with higher payment outflows to our STA program subcons that we expect will ultimately be reflected in higher revenue recognition in the back half of twenty twenty five.

The ending balance of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities was $484,000,000 as of the end of the fourth quarter of twenty twenty four. We exited Q4 in a strong position to execute on our organic expansion initiatives as well as inorganic options to further vertically integrate our supply chain with the critical capabilities and expand our adjustable market consistent with what we have done successfully in the past. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $23,200,000 in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty four, modestly above our guidance range of a $27,000,000 to $29,000,000 loss. The sequential improvement of $7,700,000 was primarily driven by revenue growth and gross margin improvement across both segments. And with that, let’s turn to our guidance for the first quarter of twenty twenty five.

We expect revenue in the first quarter to range between $117,000,000 and $123,000,000 representing approximately 29% year on year revenue growth at the midpoint and expect a return to sequential growth in Q2 driven by strength in our Space Systems business. We expect first quarter GAAP gross margin to range between 25% to 27% and non GAAP gross margin to range between 30% to 32%. These forecasted GAAP and non GAAP gross margins reflect less favorable mix within our Space Systems segment and a lower launch ASP driven by customer mix discussed earlier. We expect first quarter GAAP operating expenses to range between $93,000,000 and $95,000,000 and non GAAP operating expenses to range between $77,000,000 and $79,000,000 The quarter on quarter increases are driven primarily by continued Neutron investment into staff costs, prototyping and materials. We expect first quarter GAAP and non GAAP net interest expense to be $2,700,000 We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA loss to range between $33,000,000 and $35,000,000 and basic weighted average common shares outstanding to be approximately $458,000,000 shares, which excludes convertible preferred shares of approximately 51,000,000.

Lastly, given where we are in the final push to not only get Neutron to the pad this year, but also make advanced production scaling CapEx investments such as the recovery barge that Pete spoke about earlier, as well as investing in inventory for subsequent Neutron tails beyond the test launch tail this year, cash consumption will increase and diverge more than it has normally from adjusted EBITDA. We continue to see the program investment in getting to Neutron minimum viable product and infrastructure to be consistent with our initial estimates of approximately $250,000,000 to $300,000,000 having spent approximately $200,000,000 of gross GAAP OpEx and CapEx through the end of twenty twenty four on this program. Specifically, over the last four quarters, total cash consumption has been running between approximately $20,000,000 and $40,000,000 per quarter and we expect this number to increase in Q1 due to a combination of these Neutron related investments as well as long lead procurement items for our SDA program and a lack of significant contractual milestone payments receivable across our [[MDA]] [[Globalstar]] (NASDAQ:GSAT) and SDA programs in the quarter. While we proactively manage the working capital elements of our business, this unique situation is likely to result in an increase in cash consumption to approximately double from its prior range of $20,000,000 to $40,000,000 in Q1.

We expect this dynamic to moderate in coming quarters with resumption of contractual milestone payment schedules under our large space systems programs and as we get the minimum viable infrastructure in place to support the inaugural launch of Neutron later this year. And with that, we’ll hand the call over to the operator for questions.
