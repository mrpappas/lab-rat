## Notes

Rocket Lab filed a **Form 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing** for its **Annual Report on Form 10-K** for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. Key details include:

- **Reason for Delay**:
  - Rocket Lab became a **large accelerated filer** for the first time, resulting in a shortened filing deadline (60 days vs. 90 days).
  - Compliance with new reporting requirements under **Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act** required additional procedures, including the assessment of internal controls.

- **Expected Filing Timeline**:
  - The Annual Report is anticipated to be filed within the 15-day extension period as per Rule 12b-25.

- **Financial Results**:
  - Preliminary, unaudited results were included in the Q4 2022 earnings release on February 28, 2023. These results are subject to change upon final review.

Rocket Lab is committed to completing its year-end reporting processes and filing the 10-K within the allowed extension period.
