## Notes

- On **September 6, 2022**, [[Shaun O'Donnell]] was awarded **724,772 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**, of which **543,579 shares** were issued upon settlement, with the remaining **181,193 RSUs** subject to service-based vesting.  
- These RSUs are contingent upon a **service-based vesting condition** and a **liquidity-based vesting condition**, which was waived by the Board on the same date.  
- The filing corrects misstatements in the original Form 4 regarding the number of shares issued and the time-based vesting schedule.
