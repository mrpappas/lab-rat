## Notes

- **Rocket Lab USA, Inc.** announced the **extension of the redemption date** for its **public warrants**.
  - The redemption date was extended from **January 21, 2022**, to **January 31, 2022**, at 5:00 PM New York City time.
  - This extension provides additional time for warrant holders, particularly retail investors, to exercise their warrants.
- Key terms of the warrants:
  - Cash exercise price: **$11.50 per share**.
  - Cashless exercise ratio: **0.2843 shares per warrant**.
  - Warrants not exercised by the new redemption date will be void, redeemable only for $0.10 per warrant.
- This action aims to ensure retail investors are not disadvantaged by insufficient notice of redemption terms.
