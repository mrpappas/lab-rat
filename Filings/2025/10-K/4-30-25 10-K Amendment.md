## Filing Overview

**Filing Date**: 2025-04-30  
**Type of Filing**: [[Filing Definitions#10-K|10-K]]  
**Fiscal Year End**: 2024-12-31  
**Amendment**: Yes (Form 10-K/A Amendment No. 1)  
**Reason for Amendment**: To provide Part III information (Items 10-14), which was previously omitted under General Instruction G(3)

## Notes

- This Form 10-K/A amends Rocket Labâ€™s original 10-K (filed February 27, 2025) solely to include **Items 10 through 14 of Part III**, covering corporate governance, executive compensation, beneficial ownership, related party transactions, and principal accounting fees.
- The amendment was necessary because the company did not file its definitive proxy statement within the 120-day window permitted for incorporating this information by reference.
- No changes were made to the financial statements or other disclosures in the original 10-K, and the amendment should be read alongside the original filing.
- Notable disclosures include compensation adjustments and RSU grants for [[Peter Beck]] and [[Frank Klein]], and additional governance details regarding committees and director independence.
- Certifications required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are included, but no financial statement certifications are necessary due to the lack of financial amendments.
