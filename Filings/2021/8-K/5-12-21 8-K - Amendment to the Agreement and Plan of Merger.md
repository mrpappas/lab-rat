## Notes

- **Vector Acquisition Corporation** announced amendments to its Agreement and Plan of Merger with [[Rocket Lab]] and Prestige USA Merger Sub, Inc.  
- Key updates include a revised voting structure where Vector Class A and Class B shares convert into corresponding Delaware classes with adjusted voting rights. The structure simplifies administration during the merger's initial phase.
- The transaction entails domestication of Vector to Delaware, followed by two merger phases:
  1. Merger Sub into Vector Delaware.
  2. Rocket Lab into Vector Delaware.  
- Post-merger, Vector Delaware will operate with a unified share class for equal voting rights.
