This evening in Wellington I had the pleasure of seeing Lachlan Matchett named New Zealand Young Engineer of the Year.

Lachlan, who leads Rocket Lab’s propulsion team, is a phenomenal engineer and leader. To the group of us with him at the IPENZ event tonight, it was unsurprising when the award was announced.

Lachlan started working with Rocket Lab in late 2012 while he was completing his Masters in Electrical Engineering at the University of Canterbury. Since then, he has been responsible for overseeing one of the most significant engineering projects in Rocket Lab’s history — the development of the Rutherford engine. He led the project from day one, and the propulsion team has worked to evolve the Rutherford from a blank piece of paper into a flight-qualified state-of-the-art rocket engine with a higher thrust-to-weight ratio than the Space Shuttle’s main engine.

Lachlan is one of the many talented, passionate engineers who work at Rocket Lab - if you’re interested in joining our team I would encourage you to take a look at our careers page!

Cheers,
Pete
