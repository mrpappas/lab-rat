## Notes

- **Material Definitive Agreement**: Rocket Lab entered into a **Master Equipment Financing Agreement** with **Trinity Capital, Inc.** for up to **$120 million** in equipment financing. Initial advances of **$70 million** and **$40 million** were secured with repayment terms extending to 2029. Additional draws are subject to conditions and will be available until mid-2025.
- **Security Agreement**: Obligations under the financing are secured by a **first priority lien** on the financed equipment and, while certain obligations remain outstanding, on the company's assets, including intellectual property.
- **Equity Securities**: A warrant was issued to Trinity Capital for **728,835 shares** of common stock at an exercise price of **$4.87/share**, exercisable until **December 2027**.
- **Hercules Capital Loan Repayment**: Rocket Lab used proceeds from the financing to repay **$108.65 million** in outstanding obligations to Hercules Capital, terminating that prior agreement and releasing associated liens.

### Implications
- The financing arrangement enhances Rocket Lab's liquidity to support operational and capital investments, such as the **Neutron Launch Vehicle** development.
- The issuance of equity warrants may lead to minor dilution depending on future exercise terms.
