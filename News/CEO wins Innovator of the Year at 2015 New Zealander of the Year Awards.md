Peter Beck, founder and CEO of aerospace company Rocket Lab, has been named Sanitarium Innovator of the Year at the 2015 Kiwibank New Zealander of the Year Awards.

The award was presented to Peter at an award ceremony in Auckland last night.

“The Sanitarium Health & Wellbeing Innovator of the Year recognises inspiring Kiwis whose game-changing discoveries, research or inventions are driving society forward,” said award organisers.

The nomination reflects Peter’s commitment to making space accessible. Rocket Lab’s current project, *Electron,* will enable world-first low-cost, high-frequency rocket launches.

“Making it easier to access space will enable a critical mass of small satellites to orbit the earth,” said Peter. “This infrastructure will improve the monitoring and optimisation of crops, understanding weather and climate change, real time mapping, and provide internet and phone coverage to areas and countries that were previously out of range.”

This is not the first time Peter and his team at Rocket Lab have been awarded for innovation – last year the company won an award for ‘Innovation in Design and Engineering’ at the 2014 New Zealand Innovator Awards, and Peter won ‘Most Inspiring Individual’.
