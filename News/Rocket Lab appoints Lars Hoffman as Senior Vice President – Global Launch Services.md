**Rocket Lab appoints Lars Hoffman as Senior Vice President – Global Launch Services**

*The former SpaceX executive joins Rocket Lab’s leadership team, strengthening the industry’s premium dedicated small satellite launch experience* 

**Huntington Beach, California – January 8, 2019:** Small satellite launch provider Rocket Lab has appointed Lars Hoffman to the role of Senior Vice President (SVP) – Global Launch Services, as the company enters its second year of commercial orbital launches.

In his role as SVP – Global Launch Services, Mr. Hoffman will lead Rocket Lab’s sales, business development and customer experience teams to continue delivering frequent, reliable and tailored launch services to the small satellite market.

Mr. Hoffman brings with him more than 30 years of experience in national security and aerospace, following a distinguished US Air Force career and corporate executive roles in the commercial space sector.  Mr. Hoffman joins Rocket Lab from his most recent role at SpaceX, where he was responsible for National Security Space (NSS) strategy and business development as Senior Director of Government Sales.

The appointment comes as Rocket Lab begins its busiest launch year yet, with monthly orbital missions scheduled across the company’s two private launch pads in Māhia, New Zealand and Virginia, USA.

“Lars is a proven leader who will guide the Rocket Lab Launch Services team as they continue to deliver the premium launch service that the small satellite industry enjoys on Electron,” says Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck. “Rocket Lab has not only revolutionized the way we build and launch rockets, but we’ve also streamlined the process for procuring launch services by creating an unrivalled launch experience that is rapid, agile and tailored to customer requirements.  Lars’ wealth of industry experience will play a key role in continuing to provide Rocket Lab customers with premium service and an unparalleled ride to orbit, on their terms and time frames.”

Joining the team at Rocket Lab’s Huntington Beach headquarters this week, Mr. Hoffman says, "I’m excited to join the Rocket Lab team and I look forward to providing our customers with an outstanding launch experience from beginning to end.”
