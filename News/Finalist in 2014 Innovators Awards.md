Rocket Lab is proud to be named amongst the finalists in the 2014 New Zealand Innovators Awards.

The awards recognize and celebrate high growth organizations and showcase the country’s most inspiring and important innovations.

Rocket Lab’s Electron launch vehicle is a finalist in two categories: ‘Innovation in Design and Engineering’ and ‘Innovation Excellence in Research’, while Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck is a finalist in the category ‘Most Inspiring Individual.’

Electron uses a [world-first propulsion system](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about-us/propulsion/rutherford/ "Rutherford") and [carbon-composite structures](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about-us/vehicle-technologies/carbon-composite-technologies/ "Carbon Composite Technologies") to reduce the time and cost of launch. Such a launch service will be transformative for the emerging small-satellite market, promoting rapid growth in areas such as communication and Earth observation.
