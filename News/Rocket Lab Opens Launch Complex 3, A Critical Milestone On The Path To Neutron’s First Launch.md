Long Beach, Calif. August 28, 2025: Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, t oday celebrated the official opening of Launch Complex 3, its dedicated test, launch, and landing facility for its reusable rocket Neutron - representing a bold step forward in delivering an alternative, reliable, and responsive launch capability from U.S. soil with its next-generation challenger to the medium-lift launch industry.

Located within the Virginia Spaceport Authority’s (VSA) Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) at Pad 0D on Wallops Island, Virginia, Launch Complex 3 stands ready to deliver the largest orbital launch capacity in the Spaceport’s history with Neutron: Rocket Lab’s reusable launch vehicle capable of launching 13,000kg (33,000 pounds) to space for commercial constellations, national security and interplanetary missions, and eventually human spaceflight.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Launch Complex 3 is our commitment to providing assured access to space and the launch site diversity that’s needed in the United States for its most important missions. Our Neutron rocket, with its ability for responsive space access as a high cadence reusable launch vehicle, expands Virginia’s aerospace capabilities to enable the United States to quickly and reliably reach the International Space Station and low Earth orbit, as well as explore beyond Earth and on to the Moon and Mars. Together with the Commonwealth of Virginia, VSA, and NASA, we’re strengthening the nation’s leadership in space while creating new opportunities for innovation and growth in the state and beyond, and I’m thankful for their continued support of Rocket Lab in Virginia.”

Rocket Lab Vice President – Neutron, Shaun D’Mello, says: “Launch Complex 3 is an incredibly complex engineering feat that serves as a monument to exquisite design, streamlined operations, and the competitive advantage of Rocket Lab’s speed and efficiency. That Launch Complex 3 was built and is now operational in less than two years of construction is down to the unwavering dedication from our Virginia-based team of 60+ highly skilled staff, and the continued support, investment, and commitment from our partners in the state of Virginia. I’m excited to bring a new launch capability to Wallops Island with Neutron ahead of its maiden flight from Launch Complex 3.”

- Governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin: “The opening of L aunch Complex 3 at Pad 0-D is not only an engineering achievement, but a bold step forward for Virginia’s growing role in our nation’s commercial space industry. From right here on Virginia’s beautiful Eastern Shore, Neutron will deliver reliable and responsive launch capabilities, supporting national security while creating opportunities for innovation and economic growth. Thank you to Sir Peter Beck and the Rocket Lab team for choosing to invest and grow right here in the Commonwealth.”

- Congresswoman Jen Kiggans: “American ingenuity and innovation in the aerospace industry is essential to strengthening our national security. The capabilities at Launch Complex 3 are extraordinary, and they mark an important milestone in expanding U.S. launch capabilities, advancing technology, and driving economic growth right here in Virginia. This investment not only reinforces America’s position as leading the world in commercial rocket launch, but also highlights the incredible role the Commonwealth plays in shaping the future of aerospace.”

- Virginia Secretary of Transportation W. Sheppard Miller III. “Once again, we see leading aerospace companies choosing Virginia because of our infrastructure. Whether that infrastructure is a road, bridge, railroad, seaport, airport or even a spaceport, we know that Virginia has it all. Our willingness to invest in and provide top-notch infrastructure assets provides companies like Rocket Lab exactly what they need to grow and thrive, and I’m thrilled that Rocket Lab has chosen once more to innovate right here at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport.”

- Roosevelt Mercer, Jr., Maj Gen, USAF (Ret.), CEO & Executive Director of the Virginia Spaceport Authority: “Virginia’s spaceport is one of the Commonwealth’s most strategic assets. By expanding our capabilities and partnering with world-class companies like Rocket Lab, we are securing Virginia’s place at the forefront of the space industry, positively impacting Virginia’s economy and providing assured access to space for the nation.”

**About Launch Complex 3**

Designed to support testing, launch, and return-to-Earth missions for Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket, Launch Complex 3 plays a vital role in ensuring American leadership in space as a rapid response capable launch site.

Construction on Launch Complex 3 began in late 2023, with the site operational and officially opened in August 2025.More than 60 contractors were involved in the site’s development to supply services, hardware, and materials – many of them Virginia-based local workers and companies.

Domestically sourced infrastructure designed, tested, and operated by Rocket Lab includes:

- T he site’s 9 \-m (~30 ft) tall launch mount containing 700+ tons of steel, operated by hydraulic mechanisms that support, hold, and subsequently release Neutron for test and launch operations;

- Launch equipment vaults housing electrical and controls equipment needed to operate the site’s ground systems and launch vehicle;

- 180,000 gallon LOX and LNG propellant farms that store and load Neutron with fuel and oxidizer for test and launch operations, alongside 45,000 gallons of stored liquid nitrogen in three vertical tanks;

- A 200,000+ gallon capacity water supply tower standing at 200 + ft tall.

Launch Complex 3 is Rocket Lab’s fourth launch site. Its completed construction in less than two years is the latest demonstration of the Company’s speed and expertise at delivering world-class launch facilities globally. Launch Complex 3 is located directly next to Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2, the Company’s exclusive-use orbital launch pad for its Electron launch vehicle - the world’s most frequently flown small orbital rocket – within the same spaceport, further strengthening the nation’s leadership in space while creating new opportunities for innovation and growth in Virginia and beyond.
