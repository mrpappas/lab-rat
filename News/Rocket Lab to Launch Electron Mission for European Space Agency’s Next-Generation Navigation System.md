Long Beach, California. June 25, 2025 – Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has been selected to launch a dedicated Electron mission for the European Space Agency (“ESA”) for the first time, to deploy the first pair of satellites for a future navigation constellation for Europe, LEO-PNT.

Rocket Lab will launch two “Pathfinder A” spacecraft for ESA, provided by European satellite prime contractors Thales Alenia Space and GMV, from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 no earlier than December 2025.

The spacecraft will be deployed to a 510km low Earth orbit as part of a mission to test a new approach of providing location, direction, and timing services from satellites in low orbit – otherwise called LEO-PNT (Low Earth Orbit Positioning, Navigation, and Timing). ESA’s LEO-PNT demonstration mission will assess how a low Earth orbit fleet of satellites can work in combination with the Galileo and EGNOS constellations in higher orbits that provide Europe’s own global navigation system.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Launching a European mission on Electron that is integral to the future of Europe’s satellite navigation system is both an honor and a testament to our industry-leading launch service. An important constellation like LEO-PNT needs a strong foundation to grow from, and with Electron’s track record of precise orbital deployment, we’re excited to help secure the future of LEO-PNT for Europe with our launch of these first two satellites in the constellation.”

This latest launch contract underscores Electron’s international reputation as an industry-leading launcher, and reinforces Rocket Lab’s commitment to supporting the growing demand for space access by European constellation operators. Earlier this year Electron completed the deployment of an entire constellation of Internet-of-Things satellites for French satellite operator Kinéis, before launching a global wildfire detection mission for Germany-based customer OroraTech. Missions for other European satellite operators on Electron date back to 2021.
