**Long Beach, Calif. August 6, 2025** – Rocket Lab National Security LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket Lab USA (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the successful completion of their Systems Integration Review (SIR) for the U.S. Space Force’s (USSF) VICTUS HAZE mission, part of Space Systems Command’s (SSC) Tactically Responsive Space (TacRS) program, led by Space Safari, in partnership with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU).

The SIR was completed in May and marked a critical program milestone, confirming that all spacecraft components, systems, and software were ready for final integration and testing. The milestone followed [Rocket Lab’s successful Critical Design Review](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-clears-critical-design-review-for-space-force-victus-haze-mission/) earlier in the year, which validated the mission design and cleared the way for production. Following the SIR, Rocket Lab completed spacecraft integration, and the vehicle is now entering final testing [just 15 months after contract award](https://rocketlabcorp.com/updates/rocket-lab-selected-by-space-systems-command-to-build-and-launch-spacecraft-for-tactically-responsive-space-tacrs-mission/), underscoring Rocket Lab’s speed and efficiency.

Rocket Lab is the only provider delivering a complete, end-to-end mission solution to Space Safari. This includes satellite design, component manufacturing, satellite integration and testing, flight and ground software, mission and launch licensing, launch, commissioning, and on-orbit operations. Rocket Lab owns the entire mission lifecycle, simplifying program execution, reducing cost and schedule risk, and enabling rapid, responsive delivery.

“VICTUS HAZE is about more than responsive launch, it’s about ensuring the U.S. can act at the speed of need in a contested space domain,” said Brad Clevenger, President of Rocket Lab National Security. “With Rocket Lab’s flight-proven systems and fully integrated mission capability, we’re uniquely positioned to deliver the agility, speed, and reliability that national security demands.”

VICTUS HAZE will be a proving ground for how Rocket Lab can rapidly build, deploy, and operate spacecraft in response to emergent U.S. national security needs. The mission will demonstrate the ability to launch and conduct rendezvous and proximity operations on tactically relevant timelines, showcasing what’s possible when commercial innovation is applied to national defense priorities.

By leveraging commercial partners like Rocket Lab, the program supports broader USSF goals accelerating the transition from demonstration of responsive space concepts to fully operational national security capabilities.

Rocket Lab will complete final environmental testing and readiness milestones in the coming months.
