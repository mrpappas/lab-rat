LONG BEACH, Calif. Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2021.

“In the third quarter of 2021, Rocket Lab continued to deliver reliable end-to-end space services, including completing another successful Electron launch delivering a satellite to orbit for the United States Space Force, progressing development of the Lunar Photon spacecraft for the upcoming CAPSTONE mission to the Moon for NASA, and delivering the highest volume of star trackers and reaction wheels to customers in a single quarter from our satellite components business,” said Rocket Lab Founder and CEO, Peter Beck. “At the same time, we continue to see strong growth from constellation customers selecting Electron as their preferred launch vehicle to deploy spacecraft across multiple missions. In the third quarter, this growth in constellation customers included entering into a contract with global Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity provider Kinéis to deploy 25 satellites across five dedicated Electron launches. This multi-launch constellation contract follows on from the five-launch contract with geospatial intelligence constellation operator BlackSky signed earlier this year.”

**Third Quarter 2021 Business Highlights:**
