**Long Beach, California. October 1, 2025** – Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the launch window for its next mission for Synspective, a leading Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data and analytics company from Japan.

The mission, named “Owl New World”, will launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand during a launch window that opens on October 14 UTC. The mission will deploy the seventh StriX satellite, the first of a new generation of satellites by Synspective for its low Earth orbit constellation that provides high-frequency, high-resolution Earth observation data for disaster response and management, national security, and environmental monitoring.

“Owl New World” will be Rocket Lab’s seventh launch for Synspective and is the next launch in a series of [21 upcoming missions](https://rocketlabcorp.com/updates/rocket-lab-and-synspective-strike-another-10-launch-deal-boosting-contracted-missions-to-21-electron-launches/) to deploy the company’s Earth-imaging constellation before the end of the decade. Electron has already successfully deployed six StriX satellites across six dedicated missions as the constellation’s sole launch provider to date.

The mission will be Rocket Lab’s 15th launch this year and 73rd launch overall. With 100% mission success across all missions this year and a projected 20+ launches in 2025, Electron continues to set the industry benchmark as the world’s most frequently launched commercial small orbital rocket.
