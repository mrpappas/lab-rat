### Rocket Lab Schedules Two Launches Three Days Apart, Upcoming Mission to Deploy Final Satellites in Kinéis Constellation


***The launch for Kinéis is the fifth in a series of five dedicated Electron launches for the French Internet-of-Things constellation operator, and will put Rocket Lab on track to deploy the entire constellation in less than a year***

LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rocket Lab USA, Inc (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: RKLB), a leading launch provider and space systems company, today announced it has scheduled two Electron launches from its privately owned launch site in New Zealand three days apart, a first for the Company.

Rocket Lab [will launch its next Electron rocket no earlier than March 15<sup>th</sup> NZDT](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocketlabusa.com%2Fmissions%2Fnext-mission%2F&esheet=54221587&newsitemid=20250310605839&lan=en-US&anchor=will+launch+its+next+Electron+rocket+no+earlier+than+March+15th+NZDT&index=1&md5=67689daf3f7413ee0dffc88bd4184f0c) for its customer iQPS, followed three days later by its latest launch for Kinéis, a global Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity provider, during a launch window that opens on March 18<sup>th</sup> NZDT.

The “High Five” mission for Kinéis is the fifth of five dedicated Electron launches in a multi-launch contract with the company that will see Rocket Lab deploy an entire constellation of 25 IoT satellites in less than a year. The first four missions were successfully launched by Electron in June, September, November 2024, and February 2025. The “High Five” launch will be Rocket Lab’s 62<sup>nd</sup> Electron launch overall and fourth launch of 2025.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “An entire constellation deployed to precise orbits on the customers’ schedule in less than a year – that’s the value that dedicated launch on Electron delivers to our customers. Doing so back-to-back with another mission from the same launch site only days prior even further attests to Electron’s industry leadership for satellite operators globally. We’re proud to be teaming up with Kinéis once again to bring their IoT constellation to life in short order.”

"This fifth launch with Rocket Lab will mark a major milestone for Kinéis: the completion of our constellation deployment in less than a year. I commend the commitment and professionalism of the Kinéis teams, Rocket Lab, and all our partners – a tremendous challenge successfully achieved together!" Michel Sarthou, Kinéis Chief Technology Officer.
