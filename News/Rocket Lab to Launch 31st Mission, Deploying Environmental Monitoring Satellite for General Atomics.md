*As the eighth Electron mission of the year, the launch will see the Company surpass its previous record of seven launches in one year*

**LONG BEACH, Calif. Oct. 4, 2022** ‚Äì Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (‚ÄúRocket Lab‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Company‚Äù), a leading launch and space systems company, is preparing to launch its 31<sup>st</sup> Electron rocket and 151<sup>st</sup> satellite to orbit during a dedicated mission for [[General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems]] (GA-EMS) on Friday, October 7 UTC. ¬†¬†

The launch will take place from [[Launch Complex 1#üöÄ Launch Pad B (LC-1B)|Pad B]] at Rocket Lab [[Launch Complex 1]] on New Zealand‚Äôs Mahia Peninsula. The launch window opens 17:09 UTC on October 7th (06:09 NZDT, October 8th). Back-up opportunities are available in following days to accommodate potential weather delays to the launch.

The ‚ÄúIt Argos Up From Here‚Äù mission will launch the GA-EMS-designed and manufactured [[General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems#üõ∞Ô∏è Space Systems#GAzelle|GAzelle]] satellite carrying the [[CNES#üõ∞Ô∏è Space Systems#Argos-4|Argos-4]] Advanced Data Collection (A-DCS) payload. The A-DCS mission is supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Cooperative Data and Rescue Services Program, which arranged the launch through the Hosted Payload Solutions contract vehicle administered by the U.S. Space Force‚Äôs Space Systems Command. Once in orbit, Argos-4 will join a network of other Argos instruments in orbit to collect a variety of data from both stationary and mobile transmitters around the world. This vital information helps provide a better understanding of Earth‚Äôs physical and biological environment, including its weather and climate, biodiversity and ecosystems, as well as assist with maritime security, offshore pollution, and humanitarian assistance.

The launch will be broadcast live from approximately 20 minutes prior to lift-off at [www.rocketlabusa.com/live-stream/](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/live-stream/).
