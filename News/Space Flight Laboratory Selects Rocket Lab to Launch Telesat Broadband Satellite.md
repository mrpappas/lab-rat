**Long Beach, California. May 31, 2023** – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has signed a deal to launch the LEO 3 satellite for global satellite operator [[Telesat]] (Nasdaq and TSX: TSAT) on an Electron mission scheduled for Q3, 2023. The satellite has been built and manifested to Electron by mission management provider and satellite developer Space Flight Laboratory (SFL) of Toronto.

The LEO 3 demonstration satellite will provide continuity for customer and ecosystem vendor testing campaigns following the decommissioning of Telesat’s Phase 1 LEO satellite. Once deployed to orbit, LEO 3 will operate under an existing ITU network filing for Telesat Lightspeed, the company’s enterprise-class LEO constellation

The Electron mission that will carry the LEO 3 satellite is scheduled for lift-off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand no earlier than Q3 2023. To meet Telesat’s program requirements, SFL has selected Rocket Lab to deliver the satellite to space on an accelerated timeline within four months of contract signing.

The launch of LEO 3 for Telesat and SFL follows the successful deployment of three satellites built by SFL for radio frequency data analytics company HawkEye 360, which launched on the first Electron mission of the year in January 2023.

Rocket Lab Senior Director of Global Launch Services Brian Rogers said: “As the only U.S. small rocket to successfully deliver satellites to orbit this year, Electron remains the undisputed small launch leader for reliable and regular satellite delivery to orbit. Whether it’s a dedicated or rideshare mission, our customers know they can rely on Electron to get their satellites delivered.”

“Electron was selected to launch LEO 3 given Rocket Lab’s ability to meet the mission’s special orbital requirements and the desire for rapid turnaround," says Dr. Robert Zee, Director, SFL.  "As a complete mission provider, we are pleased to have been able to identify and secure this launch to meet Telesat's commercial needs."
