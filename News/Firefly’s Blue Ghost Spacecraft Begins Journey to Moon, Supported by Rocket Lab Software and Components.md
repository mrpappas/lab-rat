**Long Beach, Calif. January 23, 2025** – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, celebrates the successful launch of Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 on January 15. Rocket Lab is supporting Blue Ghost’s 45-day journey to the Moon with the Company’s [MAX Flight and MAX Ground Data Software suites](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/space-software/).

Rocket Lab also provided three high-efficiency photovoltaic assemblies, comprising our interconnected space-grade solar cells, mounted on the lander’s sides and top deck, providing 400 W of power over 1,470 operational hours to support the lander during its journey to the lunar surface.

During the Blue Ghost mission, the Rocket Lab team will also support Firefly’s execution of multiple burns and management of orbit determination and attitude control throughout the cruise and landing phases of the mission.

Firefly’s [Blue Ghost mission](https://fireflyspace.com/missions/blue-ghost-mission-1/) is advancing lunar science and exploration by delivering state-of-the-art instruments and technology demonstrations to the Moon as part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program.

“Congratulations to the Firefly team on the start of Blue Ghost’s lunar journey. We’re immensely proud to support the team and enable an ambitious lunar mission with our flight-proven components and software,” said Rocket Lab’s Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Space Systems, Richard French. “The new era of commercial lunar exploration is underway, and we’re excited to be part of making it possible.”
