Auckland, New Zealand – 17 December, 2018: Rocket Lab has today awarded Wairoa College student Mya Mataki-Wilson the 2018 Rocket Lab scholarship, giving her a head-start in her future engineering career.

Now in its second year, the annual Rocket Lab scholarship encourages students from Māhia and the wider Wairoa District in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand, to pursue tertiary study in science, technology and engineering disciplines.  The scholarship covers up to $20,000 of tertiary education fees for up to four years of study, and includes hands-on mentorship from Rocket Lab.

After a rigorous selection process, Miss Mataki-Wilson was chosen from a pool of talented candidates as this year’s scholarship recipient after demonstrating her passion for engineering and problem-solving.

Miss Mataki-Wilson will begin her tertiary studies at the University of Auckland in 2019, where she plans to do a conjoint degree, studying a Bachelor of Engineering and a Bachelor of Arts. The 17-year-old says she eventually wants to be a civil, or chemical and bioprocess engineer.

Miss Mataki-Wilson says she’s thrilled to be awarded the scholarship and says it will give her the freedom to focus entirely on her studies.

“The scholarship will be a huge help. It will take the financial stress away and allow me to concentrate on my study, putting me in a strong position for my future, she says.

“I loved school-work, especially science and maths, so I’m very much looking forward to broadening my skill set at university. The engineering degree will be a great match for me.”

Rocket Lab Founder and Chief Executive Peter Beck says, “It’s so important we invest in our next generation of innovators and technology leaders.  Growing a talented pool of STEM professionals is something I’m passionate about. Rocket Lab is honoured to support dedicated students, like Mya, while they develop their skills for the future.”

The Rocket Lab scholarship was founded in 2017 to directly support the community surrounding Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 on the Māhia Peninsula. It is designed to foster continued excellence and innovation amongst New Zealand’s future science, technology, mathematics and engineering leaders. Applications for the annual Rocket Lab scholarship open each year in October at [www.rocketlabusa.com](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/)
