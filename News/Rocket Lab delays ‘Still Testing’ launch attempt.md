**Saturday 16 December NZDT**: Rocket Lab has delayed its second test flight of the Electron rocket until early 2018. 

Corrective measures have been put in place for the power fault discovered during ground checkouts on Friday 15 December NZDT, however with only one day remaining in the launch window Rocket Lab has made the decision to delay an attempt until the new year. The current launch window ends on Sunday 17 December NZDT and will not to be extended in order to preserve launch team rest time. 

New ‘Still Testing’ launch window dates will be released when established early in the new year.
