Mahia, New Zealand. November 20, 2025: Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today completed its second launch in two days from its launch sites in two hemispheres, setting a new annual launch record for the Company: 18 Electron launches in 2025 with 100% mission success.

The “Follow My Speed” mission lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand on November 20, 2025 at 12:43 UTC (November 21, 2025 at 1:43 am NZDT) to successfully deploy its payload for a confidential commercial customer. The mission launched just two days after the Company’s [latest launch from Launch Complex 2 on Wallops Island, Virginia](https://rocketlabcorp.com/updates/rocketlab-haste-diu-mda/), Rocket Lab’s third HASTE launch this year and sixth mission overall involving its suborbital variant of Electron for hypersonic technology test flights.

These record-setting events further solidify Electron’s industry leadership as the world’s most frequently launched small orbital rocket. Rocket Lab has increased the annual launch cadence of Electron by 1,700% in less than a decade, driven by international demand for its responsive space capabilities and proven execution with pinpoint payload deployment accuracy.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Electron once again proves why it is the champion of small launch globally. These two launches serve as great examples of the team’s skill at delivering mission success for our customers anywhere, anytime, and no matter the mission profile – from a suborbital hypersonic technology demonstration to a commercial orbital mission, all within 48 hours and from opposite sides of the world. This new annual record is a proud moment for a remarkable team that continues to set new benchmarks for the launch industry.”

Rocket Lab remains on track to further extend Electron’s annual launch record and end the year with more launches scheduled. Details on upcoming missions will be shared at [www.rocketlabcorp.com](http://www.rocketlabcorp.com/)
