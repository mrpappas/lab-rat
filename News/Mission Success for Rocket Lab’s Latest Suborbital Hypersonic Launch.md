**Long Beach, Calif. 09 December, 2024.** Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it successfully launched a suborbital mission in November to test hypersonic technology for the Department of Defense.

This mission provided hypersonic test launch capabilities under the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonics Test Bed (MACH-TB) project, which aims to increase hypersonic flight testing for the United States in support of technology maturation. The project was awarded by Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane through the Strategic and Spectrum Missions Advanced Resilient Trusted Systems (S2MARTS) Other Transaction Authority (OTA) vehicle on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).

George Rumford, Director of the TRMC, states: “Leveraging commercial launch services allows our Nation to affordably test components early and frequently, accelerating hypersonic development.”

Rocket Lab’s test platform showcased a new suite of cutting-edge technologies optimized for hypersonic technology tests with vastly increased payloads. Rocket Lab also designed, manufactured, assembled, and integrated the experimental hypersonic instrumentation which was launched on this mission, but on a highly accelerated timeline.

Rocket Lab’s Vice President Global Launch Services, Brian Rogers, says: “Hypersonic technology testing is a critical need for the nation and one that we’re proud to be serving with our test launches. Again, we broke new ground with this launch, and our ability to deliver successful tests demonstrates our commitment to working with our government and industry partners in pushing the boundaries of hypersonic innovation.”

Rocket Lab has been launching missions to space for commercial and government customers since 2017, with more than 200 payloads deployed from its United States and New Zealand launch sites.
