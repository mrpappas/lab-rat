*The program will demonstrate Rocket Lab’s tactically responsive space capabilities using the Company’s end-to-end solutions for spacecraft design, production, launch, and operations.*

Long Beach, Calif. February 24, 2025 – Rocket Lab National Security LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket Lab USA, Inc (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the successful completion of its Critical Design Review (CDR) for the [[U.S. Space Force]] Space Systems Command’s (SSC) Tactically Responsive Space (TacRS) mission, [[VICTUS HAZE]].

In April 2024, Rocket Lab announced its [selection for the $32M U.S. Space Force SSC](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-selected-by-space-systems-command-to-build-and-launch-spacecraft-for-tactically-responsive-space-tacrs-mission/) mission led by Space Safari in partnership with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to design, build, license, launch and operate a rendezvous and proximity operations-capable spacecraft. Rocket Lab will configure its vertically integrated Pioneer spacecraft to meet the unique requirements of the VICTUS HAZE mission and launch it on the Company’s Electron rocket from Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand.

The VICTUS HAZE mission will demonstrate responsive space capabilities (launch readiness within 24 hours’ notice), rendezvous and proximity operations (ability to track and reach a target object) and the ability to identify and characterize on-orbit threats. The mission leverages the Company’s end-to-end space solutions to quickly respond to potential threats in orbit.

The CDR milestone is the final step in demonstrating spacecraft design, assembly, integration, test and operational plans are aligned with mission requirements and programmatic constraints.

"The ability to build a spacecraft, launch it, and operate it all in-house, on a tactically responsive timeline, is incredibly rare, but with our extensive launch heritage and deep vertical integration across space systems, we’re ideally suited to make this mission a success,” remarked Brad Clevenger, President and CEO of Rocket Lab National Security. “VICTUS HAZE solidifies Rocket Lab as a trusted and highly capable, end-to-end space company that can enable complex missions to serve the needs of the nation.”

The successful completion of CDR marks the transition to the production phase of the program, which will encompass integration of the spacecraft and launch vehicle and initiation of ground segment preparations for launch later this year.
