She was the first lieutenant general officer appointed to, and Director of Staff for, the Space Force where she established the first new military branch in 72 years, before retiring from active duty in July 2023. She had previously commanded the 30<sup>th</sup> and 45<sup>th</sup> Space Wings, the 21<sup>st</sup> Operations Group, and the 6<sup>th</sup> Space Warning Squadron.

“Nina has an accomplished background in space operations and national defense as part of her distinguished military career and we're thrilled to have her bring this wealth of knowledge to Rocket Lab,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck. “Our board is comprised of world class leaders and carefully selected subject-matter experts. Nina further strengthens this line-up as we continue to scale our launch and space systems businesses.”

Since 2021, Lt. Gen. Armagno has served as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a non-profit organization specializing in U.S. foreign policy and international relations.
