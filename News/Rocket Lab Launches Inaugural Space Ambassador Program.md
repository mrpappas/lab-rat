Rocket Lab Launches Inaugural Space Ambassador Program 

Rocket Lab is backing the next generation of Kiwi space experts with nationwide education tour


Auckland, New Zealand. 8 July 2021 – Rocket Lab has launched its inaugural Space Ambassador program to inspire rangatahi (future generations) around Aotearoa into further education and career pathways in STEM industries. The program will see Rocket Lab’s team of 30Space Ambassadors visit primary, intermediate, and secondary schools around the country delivering inspiring and interactive education experiences focused on all things space and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).

The most recent ‘Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study’ (TIMSS), a study of 580,000 children in 64 countries, shows Kiwi kids are falling behind in math and science. Our nation’s 13-year-olds recorded their worst results ever last year, with scores falling by the largest margins since the study began in 1994. As we slip down the OECD rankings for STEM subjects, New Zealand’s future of innovation and employment is at risk. Rocket Lab’s Space Ambassadors hope to change that.

“We’re on a mission to bring space down to Earth for Kiwi kids and encourage the next generation of innovators, explorers and problem-solvers,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck. ”STEM education is increasingly important for New Zealand’s future, and space exploration is a captivating way to bring STEM to life for students,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck.

Space Ambassador and Quality Engineer in Rocket Lab’s Propulsion team, Arianna Ryan, says the program is a fantastic way to reach students who might not have considered aerospace as a potential career.

“When I was at school, we didn’t have opportunities like this. I’m really excited to share my passion for space and engineering with students, particularly young women, and encourage them to pursue STEM subjects as they continue studying.”

Integrated Operations Engineer Moresby Kainuku joined the Space Ambassador program in the hopes to inspire rangatahi to seek opportunities outside of what might be typically put in front of them.

“There is a whakatauki that says, ‘tē taea e tatou te whai i te ara e kore nei tātou e taea te kite.’ – ‘you cannot follow the path that you cannot see’. I want to show kids who grew up like me that there are opportunities for them in this industry no matter what your passion is – it’s just about showing them what’s actually out there.”

Schools eager for a visit from a Rocket Lab Space Ambassador should register interest at rocketlabusa.com/education by Friday 31 July 2021 to secure a date before the end of the school year.

The Space Ambassador program is just one of many ways Rocket Lab supports careers in New Zealand’s growing space industry. More than 60 tertiary students have completed the company’s internship program, and since 2019, ninety percent of interns have joined the company in full time, permanent positions. Rocket Lab also introduced New Zealand’s first aerospace apprenticeship, which offers the opportunity for New Zealanders to gain a formal qualification while working hands-on with the company’s Electron rocket.  Currently there are 20 apprentices undertaking their aerospace and composites trades qualifications at Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab also provides financial support to employees wanting to pursue further education, and is currently supporting several employees undertaking Masters and PhD qualifications.
