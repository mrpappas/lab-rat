**Long Beach, California. November 24, 2025:** Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the launch window for the first of two dedicated Electron launches with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

The mission, named “RAISE And Shine”, will launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand during a launch window that opens on December 5 UTC. The mission will deploy the agency’s RApid Innovative payload demonstration SatellitE-4 (RAISE-4) spacecraft, a single satellite that will demonstrate eight technologies developed by private companies, universities, and research institutions throughout Japan.

“RAISE And Shine” is the first of two dedicated launches for JAXA’s Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration Program, an initiative by the agency to demonstrate new and innovative capabilities and technologies developed by Japan’s space economy. The second dedicated launch on Electron for the program is scheduled take place from Q1 2026. The missions are Rocket Lab’s first dedicated Electron launches directly contracted with JAXA, emphasizing Electron’s importance to reliable global space access for both domestic and allied international space agencies.

“RAISE And Shine” is also scheduled to be Rocket Lab’s 19th launch this year, continuing Rocket Lab’s record-breaking run of dedicated launches in a single year. Electron’s launch cadence has increased every year since its first launch as global demand continues to rise for dedicated launch to space for government and commercial small satellites.
