**Long Beach, Calif. August 23, 2025:** Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 70th Electron mission, solidifying the Company as a global leader in responsive launch services and Electron as the world’s most frequently launched small orbital rocket.

The ‘Live, Laugh, Launch’ mission lifted-off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand on August 23 at 22:42 UTC, less than three weeks after Electron’s previous successful launch from the same site.

Rocket Lab Founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: "Reaching our 70th launch is a powerful moment for Rocket Lab, and what’s even more remarkable is the pace at which we are achieving these milestones. This mission is the latest testament to the responsiveness and operational maturity of Electron and the entire Rocket Lab team.”

‘Live, Laugh, Launch’ was Electron’s 12th mission of 2025 as Rocket Lab continues to execute an accelerated schedule of Electron launches, including a record-setting prior quarter of two launches flown just two days apart from Launch Complex 1 in late June. The majority of Electron missions launched this year, including today’s mission, have been the continuation of multi-launch contracts with satellite operators to deploy their constellation in low Earth orbit – demonstrating the industry’s reliance on Electron for reliable, dedicated access to space for small satellites, all while the Company continues preparing to debut its new medium-lift reusable rocket, Neutron.

The details for Rocket Lab’s next Electron mission from Launch Complex 1 will be announced in the coming days.
