*The acquisition expands Rocket Lab’s end-to-end mission solutions with advanced electro-optical and infrared payloads for missile warning, tracking, and space domain awareness.*

**Long Beach, California – August 12, 2025 –** Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has completed the acquisition of the parent holding company of Geost, LLC (“Geost”), a leading developer of electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensor systems for national security space missions, from Lightridge Solutions, a portfolio company of ATL Partners. The acquisition, [first announced on May 27, 2025](https://rocketlabcorp.com/updates/rocket-lab-enters-payload-market-with-agreement-to-acquire-geost-adding-electro-optical-and-infrared-systems-to-its-end-to-end-space-solutions/), was completed for $275 million before closing adjustments, comprising approximately $125 million in cash and 3,057,588 shares of Rocket Lab common stock, with an additional potential earnout of up to $50 million tied to future revenue targets of Geost’s business.

With the closing of the transaction, Rocket Lab secures its status as a disruptive prime contractor for next-generation defense initiatives like the Golden Dome for America concept, and the Space Development Agency’s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, adding Optical Systems to its portfolio of capabilities as a provider of complete, mission-ready spacecraft for U.S. national security programs.

Geost’s EO/IR technologies support missile warning and tracking, tactical intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, Earth observation, and space domain awareness, core capabilities critical to U.S. space assets operating in increasingly contested environments. Founded in 2004, Geost brings a proven record of performance across classified and unclassified missions, supplying resilient payloads that enhance national security and space situational awareness. In combining with Rocket Lab, Geost will tap into the Company’s resources and manufacturing expertise to boost high-volume production, making EO/IR technologies available at scale.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “ Being able to quickly build and deploy entire satellite systems is the cornerstone of future U.S. defense strategy, and with this acquisition, we’re accelerating the delivery of mission critical payloads that support U.S. national security projects. This acquisition strengthens our role in building the resilient, responsive space architecture envisioned under Golden Dome, combining Geost’s proven sensing technologies with Rocket Lab’s ability to scale fast, secure, and integrated space solutions.”

Bill Gattle, CEO of Lightridge Solutions, adds: “ This is a pivotal next step for Geost. Becoming part of Rocket Lab enables Geost to take its sensing technologies further, faster—joining forces with a company that’s redefining space system delivery. Geost is excited to partner with a team that shares a commitment to speed, innovation, and national purpose. Together, Geost and Rocket Lab can scale production, accelerate delivery, and strengthen the critical space capabilities our nation depends on.”

Geost will continue to operate in Arizona and Virginia, expanding Rocket Lab’s footprint across North America. In acquiring Geost, Rocket Lab will gain the company’s extensive product assets and manufacturing facilities and laboratories, intellectual property, and product inventory.
