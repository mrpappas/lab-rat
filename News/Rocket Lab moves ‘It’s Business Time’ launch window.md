The shift comes after pad team identified some unusual motor controller behavior during a wet dress rehearsal carried out this week. With just days between rehearsal and window opening, the call to move to the window is a conservative one made to allow the team additional time to review data.

Rocket Lab will move the ‘It’s Business Time’ launch, scheduled between 20 April – 3 May, to the next available launch window in coming weeks. The shift comes after pad team identified some unusual motor controller behavior during a wet dress rehearsal carried out this week. With just days between rehearsal and window opening, the call to move to the window is a conservative one made to allow the team additional time to review data.

Rocket Lab is able to operate with schedule flexibility and move into different windows as a result of operating its own private orbital launch site.

The new launch window is due to open in the coming weeks with defined dates to be confirmed soon.
