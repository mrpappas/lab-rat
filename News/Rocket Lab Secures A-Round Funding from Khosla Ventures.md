Rocket Lab is excited to announce the successful raising of A-Round venture capital funding from Silicon Valley-based Khosla Ventures.

The new funding will kick-start Rocket Labâ€™s next chapter with the launch of an orbital launch vehicle program aimed at the fast-emerging small satellite market. The new programme will change the way the world thinks about access to space by removing traditional barriers to entry.
