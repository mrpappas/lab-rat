Here we go! We are about to open a 10 day launch attempt window from May 22, 2017, for the first launch attempt of our Electron rocket.

The launch, titled ‘It’s a Test’, will take place from our private orbital launch site, Launch Complex 1, on the Māhia Peninsula, New Zealand.

This is a significant milestone for Rocket Lab and the space industry globally. We are about to enter the next phase of the Electron program, which will see the culmination of years of work from our dedicated team here at Rocket Lab.

'It's a Test' is all about gathering data. There are over 20,000 channels collected during the flight. We will use this information to learn and iterate.

As with any new rocket, there are a lot of factors that come together ahead of a test and we’re not going to fly unless we’re ready. It's highly possible we will scrub multiple attempts as we fine tune and wait for favorable weather conditions.

We’re committed to making space accessible. Thanks for your interest and support - it means a lot to us.

Stay tuned!

Cheers,  
Pete
