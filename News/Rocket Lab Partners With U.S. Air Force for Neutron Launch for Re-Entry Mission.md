**Long Beach, CALIF. May 8, 2025.** Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it will launch its new medium-lift reusable rocket Neutron for the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) for a Rocket Cargo mission that supports point-to-point cargo transportation, establishing a new era of commercial launch capability to advance global defense logistics for the nation. The mission is scheduled for a return-to-Earth Neutron launch no earlier than 2026.

The launch contract will see Neutron execute a Rocket Cargo survivability experiment under the AFRL Rocket Experimentation for Global Agile Logistics (REGAL) solicitation, an effort by the Department of Defense to create a rocket-based point-to-point transportation system to quickly and rapidly deliver cargo around the world with commercial launch providers. AFRL’s experiment will be launched by Neutron and re-enter Earth’s atmosphere, in a demonstration of re-entry capability for future REGAL missions.

Rocket Lab’s Neutron medium-lift reusable launch vehicle will provide both government and commercial customers with an alternative and reliable launch service capable of deploying 13,000 kg to low Earth orbit. Neutron is tailored to deploy constellations and national security missions as well as science and exploration payloads. In addition to serving customers with greater affordability in the medium-launch market, Neutron is key to Rocket Lab’s strategy as an end-to-end space company preparing to deploy its own constellations and deliver services from space in the future.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Neutron is a powerful new launch option that will set a new standard for performance, affordability, and reliability for government and commercial space users in medium launch. This opportunity for the U.S. Air Force not only helps to advance space logistics, it also demonstrates a high degree of confidence by the DOD in Neutron’s capabilities. Anticipation is high for Neutron’s inaugural flight this year, and we’re excited to showcase Neutron as a platform for R&D for point-to-point logistics for the DoD.”

Neutron is strongly positioned to capitalize on the medium-lift launch requirements for future government and commercial missions. Recently Significant progress continues to be made at the rocket’s launch pad on Wallops Island, Virginia, with the site’s completion expected in the next few weeks. Production, infrastructure scaling, and both Archimedes engine and full-scale components testing is continuing at pace across Rocket Lab’s various production and test facilities in the United States. Neutron’s debut remains on track for first launch in the second half of 2025.
