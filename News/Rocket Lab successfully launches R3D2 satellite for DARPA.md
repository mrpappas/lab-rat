**Rocket Lab successfully launches R3D2 satellite for DARPA**¬†

*The launch marks Rocket Lab‚Äôs 25<sup>th</sup> satellite deployed to orbit, continuing the company‚Äôs mission success heritage*

Huntington Beach, California ‚Äì March 28, 2019 ‚Äì A Rocket Lab Electron launch vehicle successfully lifted off from Launch Complex 1 on New Zealand‚Äôs Mahia Peninsula at 23:27, March 28<sup>th </sup> UTC (12:27, 29 March NZDT). The mission launched a prototype reflect array antenna to orbit for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]).¬†¬†

‚ÄúCongratulations to our dedicated team for delivering another important and innovative asset to space ‚Äì on time and on target. The unique requirements of this mission made Electron the perfect launch vehicle to lift [[DARPA#üõ∞Ô∏è Space Systems#R3D2|R3D2]] as a dedicated payload to a highly precise orbit,‚Äù said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck. ‚ÄúThank you to our mission partners. We look forward to continuing to provide frequent, reliable and rapidly-acquired launch services for innovative small satellites.‚Äù

Rocket Lab was selected for the launch because of the company‚Äôs proven mission heritage and its ability support rapid acquisition of small satellite launch capabilities. Due to Rocket Lab‚Äôs streamlined acquisition practices, DARPA‚Äôs R3D2 mission was launched just over 18 months from conception ‚Äì a significant reduction in traditional government launch acquisition timeframes.

With proven flight heritage from four orbital missions, Rocket Lab is the only fully commercial small satellite launch service provider in operation. The experienced Rocket Lab team has delivered 25 satellites to orbit, including innovative new space technologies that provide vital capabilities such as weather monitoring, Earth observation and Internet of Things connectivity. The R3D2 mission was Rocket Lab‚Äôs first of 2019, as the company heads into a busy year of launches booked for lift-off every four weeks. To support the small satellite industry‚Äôs highest launch cadence, Rocket Lab is currently producing one Electron launch vehicle every 30 days across its Huntington Beach, California, and Auckland, New Zealand, production facilities.
