**Description:** Rocket Lab recently completed the first test fire of a new liquid rocket engine.

Rocket Lab recently completed the first test fire of a new liquid rocket engine.

The new engine, named Rutherford after the famous New Zealand scientist Ernest Rutherford, is a Lox/Kerosene regenerative cooled pump fed engine that is intended to be the future workhorse for the our orbital launcher program. Â The first test fires demonstrated stable performance and began the characterization phase of the engine program. A high rate of testing is underway with an average of one test fire every two days.
