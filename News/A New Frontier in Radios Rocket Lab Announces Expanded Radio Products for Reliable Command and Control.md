Long Beach, Calif. April 3, 2025 – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today introduced its expanded suite of space-grade radio frequency (RF) communications systems, the Frontier radios. The Frontier radio is flight-proven, software-defined and designed for reliable telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C).

Adapted from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory’s Frontier Lite radio, Rocket Lab’s high-performance Frontier radios have over 13 years of flight heritage and are now available in L-, S-, C-, X-, and Ka-band models. The radio is designed from the ground up for reliable and secure communications to support any orbit or space environment and have advanced capabilities like ranging waveforms for radiometric navigation. Frontier radios are compact and lightweight for easy integration onto any satellite.

As part of Rocket Lab’s vertically integrated subsystems and components, Frontier radios are compatible with the Deep Space Network and other global ground stations, including the Near Earth Network, Air Force Satellite Control Network, KSAT, SSC, Viasat, and other commercial networks.

“We are excited to add this suite of software-defined radios to our expanding portfolio of products,” said Brad Clevenger, Vice President of Rocket Lab Space Systems. “We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver high reliability, high performance products at constellation scale. While much of the industry struggles with supply chain challenges, Rocket Lab continues to demonstrate that it is the right partner for merchant component supply to the most demanding missions.”

This RF product suite is a further expansion of Rocket Lab’s component products, joining a portfolio that includes reaction wheels, star trackers, solar power systems, flight software, ground software, separation systems, and more.

Frontier radios are flight-proven across a range of missions including Rocket Lab’s Photon Pathstone, three Rocket Lab Pioneer spacecraft for Varda Space Industries, NASA’s CAPSTONE, NASA’s Europa Clipper, NASA’s Solar Probe Plus, Emirates Mars, and Van Allen Probes. Upcoming, Rocket Lab’s Frontier L-band radio will be used for [Viasat to support their hybrid space communications network demonstration](https://www.viasat.com/news/latest-news/government/2023/viasat-and-rocket-lab-partner-to-showcase-on-demand-low-latency-data-relay-services-for-leo-satellites/) s for NASA's Communications Services Project.

The Frontier Radio was also selected as a [2024 R&D 100 Award](https://www.rdworldonline.com/rd-100-winners-for-2024-are-announced/) for innovations pushing the boundaries of research and development.
