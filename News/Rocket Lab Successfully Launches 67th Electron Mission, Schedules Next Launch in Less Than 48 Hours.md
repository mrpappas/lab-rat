Mahia, New Zealand. June 27 <sup>th</sup>, 2025 – Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 67 <sup>th </sup> Electron rocket on a dedicated launch for radio frequency geospatial analytics provider HawkEye 360. In less than 48 hours of mission success, Rocket Lab is scheduled for its next Electron launch to take place on Saturday, June 28 <sup>th</sup> NZT – expected to mark the Company’s fastest launch turnaround yet from Launch Complex 1.

**Mission Success for Electron’s 67 <sup>th</sup> Launch**

“Get The Hawk Outta Here” launched on Electron from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand, at 5:28 a.m. on June 27 <sup>th</sup> NZT (17:28 on June 26 <sup>th</sup> UTC). The mission deployed four satellites to a 520 km circular low Earth orbit: a trio of microsatellites called Cluster 12 to collect and geolocate radio frequency signals from around the world, along with Kestrel-0A, an experimental satellite designed to evaluate emerging capabilities and future technology enhancements. Today’s mission was the second of three dedicated launches in a multi-launch contract for HawkEye 360, following the [company’s first mission on Electron to deploy its Cluster 5 trio of satellites in 2023](https://rocketlabcorp.com/missions/missions-launched/new-mission-page-2/).

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Today’s launch for HawkEye 360 was another seamless ride to orbit for Electron, with four satellites deployed with absolute precision to support the growth of HawkEye 360’s constellation in low Earth orbit. With our next mission set to launch in less than 48 hours— the fastest we’ve ever scheduled back-to-back missions from the same launch site — I’m proud of the team for continuing to deliver the high-cadence, responsive launch that our customers rely on.”

**Next Electron Launch Scheduled From Launch Complex 1**

The next scheduled Electron mission, “Symphony In The Stars”, will launch a single spacecraft to a 650km circular Earth orbit for a confidential commercial customer no earlier than 6:45 p.m. NZT/06:45 UTC tomorrow Saturday, June 28 <sup>th</sup>. The mission will be Rocket Lab’s 68 <sup>th</sup> Electron launch overall and tenth mission this year from Launch Complex 1.

Rocket Lab’s dynamic scheduling to meet customer and mission requirements has proven the unparalleled adaptability and responsiveness of dedicated launch on Electron. With over 20 launches possible this year, Electron is in high demand among satellite operators for commercial, civil, and government missions.
