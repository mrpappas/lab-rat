*As a prime contractor, Rocket Lab will deliver a constellation of 18 spacecraft for the Space Development Agency’s Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta program, a foundational component of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.*

Long Beach, Calif. July 1, 2025 – Rocket Lab National Security LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rocket Lab USA (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the successful completion of its Critical Design Review (CDR) for the [Space Development Agency’s](https://www.sda.mil/) (SDA) Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta (T2TL-Beta) program.

The milestone follows Rocket Lab’s successful [Preliminary Design Review in late 2024](https://rocketlabcorp.com/updates/rocket-lab-on-track-to-advance-u-s-defense-capabilities-passing-major-milestone-in-development-of-spacecraft-constellation-for-space-development-agency-2/), confirms that spacecraft design, manufacturing approach, and systems architecture meet all mission requirements and enables the program to move into full-scale production.

As a [prime contractor, Rocket Lab will deliver a constellation of 18 spacecraft](https://rocketlabcorp.com/updates/rocket-lab-makes-its-defense-prime-debut-with-0-5-billion-contract-to-design-and-build-satellite-constellation-for-space-development-agency/) for the T2TL-Beta program, part of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, a resilient, low-latency communications network in low Earth orbit (LEO) that support real-time connectivity for U.S. and allied forces worldwide.

“The Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture is reshaping how the U.S. secures space for the joint force, and Rocket Lab is proud to be a contributor,” said Brad Clevenger, President of Rocket Lab National Security. “With proven platforms and in-house production across key systems, we’re building the backbone of resilient on-orbit capability for the warfighter. Our successful completion of CDR further demonstrates our ability to deliver trusted technology at the speed and scale needed to support national security space.”

Rocket Lab’s spacecraft for the T2TL-Beta program is based on its high-performance [Lightning platform](https://rocketlabcorp.com/space-systems/spacecraft/), tailored for the power and data-handling demands of national security LEO constellations. As a vertically integrated provider, Rocket Lab designs and manufactures its spacecraft buses and key subsystems in-house, including solar panels, composite structures, star trackers, reaction wheels, radios, avionics, flight and ground software, launch dispensers, and more allowing the Company to maintain tight control over quality, cost, and schedule.
