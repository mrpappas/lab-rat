**Mahia, New Zealand. June 28, 2025:**Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 68th Electron rocket to deploy a single satellite to space for a confidential commercial customer.

The mission was the second of two launches from the same launch site in less than 48 hours, a new launch record for the Company as it continues to deliver dedicated, repeatable and reliable access to space for satellite operators.

The ‘Symphony In The Stars’ mission lifted-off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand on June 28 <sup>th</sup> (7:08 p.m./07:08 UTC) to deploy a single spacecraft to a 650km circular Earth orbit. The mission was the first of two dedicated launches for the new customer on Electron booked less than four months ago, with a second mission scheduled before the end of 2025.

Rocket Lab has now completed four launches in June for commercial satellite constellation operators, underscoring Electron's consistent performance and rapid deployment capabilities as the world’s leading small launcher: the “Full Stream Ahead” mission on June 3 <sup>rd</sup>; “The Mountain God Guards” mission on June 11 <sup>th</sup>; “Get The Hawk Outta Here” launched on June 26 <sup>th</sup> UTC, and today’s “Symphony In The Stars” mission.

Rocket Lab Founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: ““Electron has demonstrated once again that it is the gold standard for responsive and reliable space access for small satellites. The future of space is built on proven performance, and Electron continues to deliver against a stacked launch manifest this year. Congratulations to the team on achieving its fastest launch turnaround yet between two missions from Launch Complex 1. This launch was also a quick-turn mission to meet our customer’s mission requirements, and we’re looking forward to doing it again later this year.”

‘Symphony In The Stars ’ was Rocket Lab’s tenth Electron mission of 2025 and its 68th launch overall. With 100% mission success so far this year, Electron continues to deliver reliable deployment amid an increasing launch cadence and rapid contract-to-launch timelines.
