**Long Beach, Calif. October 20, 2025:** Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the launch window for its next mission for multi-launch customer Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space, Inc. (iQPS), a Japan-based Earth imaging company. The mission will be Electron’s 74 <sup>th</sup> launch to date and 16 <sup>th</sup> mission this year.

The upcoming dedicated launch, named ‘The Nation God Navigates”, is scheduled to launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand during a launch window that opens on November 5, 2025 UTC. The mission will deploy QPS-SAR-14, nicknamed YACHIHOKO-I for the Japanese god of nation-building, to a 575km circular Earth orbit. This satellite will join the rest of the QPS-SAR constellation in providing high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and Earth monitoring services globally. iQPS aims to build a constellation of 36 SAR satellites that will provide near-real-time images of Earth every 10 minutes.

‘The Nation God Navigates’ will be the sixth mission deployed on Electron for iQPS, following previous successful missions ‘ [The Moon God Awakens](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/missions-launched/the-moon-god-awakes/) ’ in December 2023 as well as ‘ [The Lightning God Reigns’](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-successfully-launches-61st-electron-mission-second-launch-for-iqps/), ‘ [The Sea God Sees’](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-successfully-launches-third-mission-for-iqps-in-multi-launch-contract-sets-schedule-for-the-next-iqps-mission/), ‘ [The Mountain God Guards](https://rocketlabcorp.com/missions/missions-launched/the-mountain-god-guards/) ’ and ‘ [The Harvest Goddess Thrives’](https://rocketlabcorp.com/updates/mission-success-for-rocket-labs-latest-constellation-deployment-launch-for-iqps/) in 2025. Beyond this mission, six more dedicated iQPS missions are set to launch on Electron in 2026 and beyond, making Rocket Lab the go-to provider for their constellation.

Rocket Lab is a leader in responsive launch and precise orbital access for a range of small satellite operators globally. The world’s most frequently launched commercial small-lift rocket, Electron continues to demonstrate its reliability amid a busy launch cadence, achieving 100% mission success on all missions this year – with more launches scheduled from now through the end of 2025.
