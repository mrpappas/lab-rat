**Long Beach, Calif. May 05, 2025:** Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the launch window for its next mission for multi-launch customer, Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space, Inc. (iQPS).

The mission, named ‘The Sea God Sees’, will launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand during a launch window that opens on May 17, 2025. The mission will launch a single synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging satellite called QPS-SAR-10 (nicknamed “WADATSUMI-I” for the Japanese god of the sea) to a 575km circular Earth orbit, from where the satellite will join the rest of the iQPS constellation in providing high resolution images and Earth monitoring services globally.

The mission will be the third overall Electron launch for iQPS and the second in a line-up of eight dedicated missions across 2025 and 2026 to deploy iQPS’s constellation. The first mission of the multi-launch contract, ‘The Lightning God Reigns’, was successfully deployed to space by Electron just weeks ago on March 15, 2025.

“The Sea God Sees” will be Rocket Lab’s sixth mission of 2025, its 64th Electron launch overall, and will bring the total number of satellites delivered to space by Rocket Lab to 225.
