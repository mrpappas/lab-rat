Long Beach, Calif. June 24, 2025 – Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced a swift turnaround in Electron’s launch manifest to fly the next mission in a multi-launch contract for geospatial analytics company HawkEye 360. The mission will fly from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in just two days’ time.

The mission, named ‘Get The Hawk Outta Here’, is scheduled to launch no earlier than Thursday, June 26 <sup>th</sup> UTC from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand, ahead of a previous Electron mission that has been rescheduled to allow for additional checkouts. This unprecedented announcement-to-launch timeline underscores Rocket Lab’s responsiveness amid a back-to-back launch schedule that requires peak operational efficiency and flexibility.

The dedicated launch for HawkEye 360 will deploy four satellites built to extract mission-critical intelligence from the radiofrequency (RF) spectrum in support of national and global security: a trio of microsats called Cluster 12 to collect and geolocate radio frequency signals from around the world, and Kestrel-0A, an experimental satellite designed to evaluate emerging capabilities and future technology enhancements.

‘Get The Hawk Outta Here’ is the third of four launches scheduled to take place this month from Launch Complex 1, following earlier successful missions on June 3 <sup>rd</sup> and June 11 <sup>th</sup>, and an additional mission, ‘Symphony in the Stars’, expected to launch this month. This dynamic launch schedule highlights Rocket Lab's growing adaptability and underscores the Company’s commitment to satisfying the diverse needs of its small satellite customers.
