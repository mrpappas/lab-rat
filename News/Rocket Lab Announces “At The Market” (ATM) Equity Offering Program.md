### Rocket Lab Announces “At The Market” (ATM) Equity Offering Program

03/11/2025

LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has filed a prospectus supplement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under which it may offer and sell from time to time and at its discretion shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $500.0 million pursuant to an “at the market” offering program (the “ATM Program”). The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds, if any, of sales of its common stock issued under the ATM offering to fund future growth, including potential future acquisitions such as Rocket Lab’s intent to acquire laser communications provider Mynaric, announced today, and for general corporate and working capital purposes. The timing of any sales and the number of shares sold, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company.

The shares will be offered pursuant to an equity distribution agreement by and among the Company, BofA Securities, Inc., Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, and TD Securities (USA) LLC, as sales agent and/or principal. Sales may be made by any method permitted by law, including in sales deemed to be “at the market offerings” as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in ordinary brokers’ transactions, to or through a market maker, on or through the Nasdaq Capital Market or any other market venue where the securities may be traded, in the over-the-counter market, in privately negotiated transactions, or through a combination of any such methods of sale. Sales may be made at market prices prevailing at the time of the sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices and, as a result, sales prices may vary.

The prospectus supplement filed today adds to, updates or otherwise changes information contained in the accompanying prospectus contained in an automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, also filed today, for the offering of shares. Prospective investors should read the prospectus in that registration statement and the prospectus supplement (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) for more complete information about Rocket Lab and the ATM Program, including the risks associated with investing in Rocket Lab.
