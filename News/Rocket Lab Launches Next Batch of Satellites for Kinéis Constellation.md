*The mission was the fourth mission in a five-launch deal with Kinéis to deploy the French company’s entire internet-of-things constellation*

Mahia, New Zealand. February 9, 2025. – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 59<sup>th </sup> [[Electron]] mission, deploying five satellites to Low Earth Orbit for French Internet-of-Things (IoT) constellation operator [[Kinéis]].

The “IOT 4 You and Me” mission lifted-off from Rocket Lab [[Launch Complex 1]] in Mahia, New Zealand at 9:43 am NZDT on 9 February (20:43 UTC), successfully deploying five satellites to a 647 km low Earth orbit. The mission was Rocket Lab’s first Electron launch of 2025, fourth launch for Kinéis to date, and 59<sup>th</sup> Electron launch overall.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir [[Peter Beck]] said: “That’s four launches done and one still to go for Kinéis, then we’ll have deployed their entire constellation in less than a year. It’s not uncommon for constellation operators to wait longer than that for their first launch, let alone have a full constellation deployed and operating. Once again Electron has shown its strength as a pinpoint accurate constellation launcher that lets customers tailor missions and schedules to their needs.”

Kinéis CTO Michel Sarthou said: "Producing 25 nanosatellites and launching them into orbit in just eight months is an unprecedented feat—and above all, a remarkable challenge! With this fourth and penultimate launch, Kinéis moves one step closer to its ambitious goal: delivering global IoT coverage through a complete constellation of 25 nanosatellites. This milestone showcases the expertise and determination of our teams and partners like Rocket Lab. We are deeply grateful for the unwavering support and commitment we have received since Kinéis was founded”.

The Kinéis constellation is designed to make it possible to connect and locate any connected object anywhere in the world, enabling data transmission to users in near-real time, at low bit rates and with very low energy consumption. By enabling internet connection to the Earth’s most remote locations, Kinéis constellation can support forest fire detection, water resource management, infrastructure and energy network monitoring, transport and logistics tracking, and much more.

The launch date for the fifth Kinéis launch in this series of missions will be announced in the coming weeks.

The next Electron launch is scheduled for lift-off in February, with the specific launch window and customer details to be announced in the coming days.
