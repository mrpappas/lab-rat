**Long Beach, California. January 9, 2025**. Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced a mutual agreement with [[NASA]] has been reached to include Neutron launch services to the agency through Rocket Lab’s existing [[VADR]] (Venture-Class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare) contract.

Rocket Lab’s new medium-lift reusable rocket Neutron allows the opportunity for Rocket Lab to continue broadening access to space to deliver multiple missions across a range of orbits, including CubeSats, [[⚖️ NASA Mission and Instrument Risk Classification#Class D|Class D]] missions, and other payloads. With its small orbital launch vehicle [[Electron]] already on-ramped for NASA’s VADR missions, Rocket Lab has demonstrated time-sensitive back-to-back launches within two weeks for the VADR PREFIRE missions and completed a similar fast turnaround of two launches in May 2023 for the VADR TROPICS missions.

[[Neutron]] is designed to provide both commercial and government customers with an alternative reliable launch service capable of deploying 13,000 kg to low Earth orbit. Neutron is tailored to deploy constellations and national security missions as well as science and exploration payloads. In addition to serving customers, Neutron is key to Rocket Lab’s strategy as an end-to-end space company capable of building, launching and operating its own constellations and delivering services from space in the future.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir [[Peter Beck]], says: “Neutron brings choice and value to the launch industry and is the ideal rocket to support NASA’s goals with VADR to provide new opportunities for science and technology payloads through commercial best practice. Rocket Lab has been a long trusted and reliable launch partner for NASA missions with Electron, and we’re proud to have been selected to expand on this with Neutron.”

Neutron is strongly positioned to capitalize on the medium-lift launch requirements for future government and commercial missions. The selection of Neutron for the [[VADR]] contract builds on previous awards for the new launch vehicle, including an on-ramp to the United States Space Force’s [[OSP-4]] program, a separate $986m IDIQ contract. Neutron is also ideally placed to be on-ramped on to the U.S. Government’s [[NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1]] program, an IDIQ contract valued at $5.6 billion over a five-year period.

Significant progress continues to be made on the rocket’s launch site on Wallops Island, Virginia, with the site’s completion expected in the coming months. Production, infrastructure scaling, and both [[Neutron#Archimedes|Archimedes]] engine and full-scale components testing is continuing at pace across Rocket Lab’s various production and test facilities throughout the United States. Neutron is scheduled for its debut launch from Rocket Lab [[Launch Complex 3]] in Virginia from mid-2025.
