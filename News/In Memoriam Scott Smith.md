**In Memoriam: Scott Smith**

We are deeply saddened by the loss of Scott Smith, a Rocket Lab board member and dear friend to our team. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.

Scott joined Rocket Lab’s board in 2015, bringing a wealth of knowledge and experience from his time at Skybox, Iridium, and Digital Globe. Scott was a passionate, dedicated and kind leader who would go to great lengths to help others achieve things in space that would help everyone down here on Earth.

In losing Scott, we have lost one of the great ones. The Rocket Lab team is incredibly lucky to have known him. He left an indelible mark on the company in some of our most crucial years. We’re a better business and a better team for having known him. We are honored to have worked with one of the pioneering entrepreneurs of the space industry.
