*The $32 million contract will see Rocket Lab design and manufacture a spacecraft to conduct rendezvous proximity operations, before launching it on Electron with 24 hours’ notice for Space Systems Command’s VICTUS HAZE mission.*

**Colorado Springs, Colo. April 11, 2024.** - Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”) today announced that it has been selected for a $32M U.S. Space Force Space Systems Command (SSC) contract to deliver the VICTUS HAZE Tactically Responsive Space (TacRS) mission. The mission will see Rocket Lab design, build, launch, and operate a rendezvous proximity operation (RPO) capable spacecraft. The mission was contracted under Rocket Lab National Security, a wholly owned subsidiary that serves the U.S. and its allies with responsive and reliable launch services, spacecraft manufacturing, and space systems capabilities.

SSC’s Space Safari’s VICTUS HAZE mission will be an exercise of a realistic threat-response scenario and on-orbit space domain awareness (SDA) demonstration. Rocket Lab and a second performer, True Anomaly, will both demonstrate the ability to build rendezvous and proximity operation (RPO) capable space vehicles and command and control centers. The mission is targeted for launch in 2025.

Once the spacecraft build is complete, Rocket Lab will be entered into a Hot Standby Phase awaiting further direction. Once the exercise begins, Rocket Lab will be given notice to launch the spacecraft into a target orbit. After reaching orbit, the spacecraft will be rapidly commissioned and readied for operations. Rocket Lab will configure a Pioneer class spacecraft bus to meet the unique requirements of the VICTUS HAZE mission and launch the spacecraft on Electron from either Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, NZ or Launch Complex 2 in Wallops, VA. Once on orbit, the spacecraft will conduct a variety of dynamic space operations to demonstrate SDA characterization capabilities with True Anomaly’s spacecraft, the Jackal autonomous orbital vehicle.

The mission will improve Tactically Responsive Space (TacRS) processes and timelines, demonstrating the ability to respond to on-orbit threats on very short timelines and validating techniques for space domain awareness (SDA) and on-orbit characterization. Rocket Lab’s constellation-class production capability and discriminating technical capabilities in the areas of in-space propulsion, precision attitude control, low latency communications, and autonomous operations are key enablers for this mission.

“It’s an honor to be selected by the Space Systems Command to partner in delivering the VICTUS HAZE mission and demonstrate the kind of advanced tactically responsive capabilities critical to evolving national security needs,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck. “VICTUS HAZE builds on Rocket Lab’s proven track record of delivering launch and spacecraft solutions that enable advanced missions on accelerated timelines. The ability to design, build, launch and operate a spacecraft within one streamlined team is rare and will deliver unparalleled speed and value to the nation. We’re excited to take TacRS to the next level.”

The VICTUS HAZE mission joins a growing list of U.S. Space Force programs supported by Rocket Lab, including the successful launch of the Space Test Program’s [Monolith satellite on Electron in 2021](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocketlabusa.com%2Fmissions%2Fmissions-launched%2Fits-a-little-chile-up-here%2F&esheet=53928569&newsitemid=20240411809011&lan=en-US&anchor=Monolith+satellite+on+Electron+in+2021&index=1&md5=d71651c7aac744ae1ce167652fbd5f15); a newly-announced [$14.49 million contract](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocketlabusa.com%2Fupdates%2Fu-s-space-force-awards-rocket-lab-launch-contract-for-space-test-program-stp-s30%2F&esheet=53928569&newsitemid=20240411809011&lan=en-US&anchor=%2414.49+million+contract&index=2&md5=d40beff86575380eee745d1025f6ffd0) to launch the SSC’s STP-30 mission on Electron within 24 months; a [$24.35 million contract](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocketlabusa.com%2Fupdates%2Frocket-lab-wins-24m-u-s-space-force-contract-to-develop-neutron-upper-stage%2F&esheet=53928569&newsitemid=20240411809011&lan=en-US&anchor=%2424.35+million+contract&index=3&md5=bc301ad5c0e2af0d3ed81b97a20374de) with the SSC for the development of the Neutron launch vehicle’s upper stage; and a recent [$515 million contract](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocketlabusa.com%2Fupdates%2Frocket-lab-makes-its-defense-prime-debut-with-0-5-billion-contract-to-design-and-build-satellite-constellation-for-space-development-agency%2F&esheet=53928569&newsitemid=20240411809011&lan=en-US&anchor=%24515+million+contract&index=4&md5=f705e07944c6c68d232d36a2d2cecaaf) award from the Space Development Agency to design and build 18 Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta Data Transport Satellites (T2TL - Beta).
