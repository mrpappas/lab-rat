*The contract for Rocket Lab’s latest launch was signed less than ten weeks before lift-off, making it one of the fastest contract-to-launch turnarounds in Company history.*

**Long Beach, California. 05 November, 2024.** Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 54<sup>th</sup> Electron mission, deploying a single satellite to Low Earth Orbit for a confidential commercial customer.

The ‘Changes in Attitudes, Changes in Latitudes’ mission launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand at 11:54 pm on November 5<sup>th</sup>, 2024. The mission was Rocket Lab’s 12<sup>th</sup> Electron launch this year, continuing to best the Company’s previous record of 10 annual launches achieved in 2023. Electron remains the world’s third most frequently launched rocket annually by vehicle type, and the United States’ second most frequently launched rocket annually.

Today’s mission was launched less than ten weeks from the mission’s launch contract signing, making it one of the Company’s fastest turnarounds yet from contract to launch. Historically it was typical to take years from contract signing to launch, causing bottlenecks and limited launch opportunities for satellite operators. Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket revolutionized this by making it possible for customers to book and launch in just weeks, enabling them to test technologies faster, begin generating revenue from constellations earlier, or gather urgent data from orbit at near on-demand timelines. This business model is enabled by standardized rapid production of Electron launch vehicles, responsive launch sites, proven and established launch systems, and an experienced team capable of delivering rapid call-up launch year-round.  

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Another successful launch showcasing all the best attributes of the Rocket Lab team and Electron: a streamlined process from contract to orbit, pinpoint deployment accuracy, and a responsive service tailored exactly to the customer’s needs. Now 12 for 12 this year across commercial, civil, and national security missions, I’m proud of the team for delivering launch after launch as we continue to deliver a record year across launch and space systems.”

Details of Rocket Lab’s next launch will be announced shortly.
