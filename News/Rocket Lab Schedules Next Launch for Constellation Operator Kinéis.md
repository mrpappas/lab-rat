Long Beach, California. 12 November, 2024 – Rocket Lab USA, Inc (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: RKLB), a leading launch provider and space systems company, today announced it has scheduled the next Electron launch for [[Kinéis]], a global Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity provider.

The “Ice AIS Baby” mission is scheduled to launch during a 14-day window that opens on November 23<sup>rd</sup> NZDT. Lift-off will take place from Rocket Lab’s private orbital launch site, Launch Complex 1, in New Zealand. The mission is the third of five dedicated Electron launches booked by Kinéis in a multi-launch contract that will see Rocket Lab deploy an entire constellation of 25 IoT satellites.  The first two missions were successfully launched by Electron in June and September 2024.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck, says: “We’ve already successfully launched two missions for Kinéis and looking forward to making it three later this month. Electron has put control in the hands of small satellite constellation operators like Kinéis, giving them the ability to control launch schedule and orbits to deploy and manage their satellites precisely the way they want to. This is what dedicated launch is all about and we’re proud to operate the only small rocket delivering this consistently and reliably.”

Kinéis CEO, Alexandre Tisserant, says: “Kinéis continues to deploy its 25-satellite constellation on schedule. Efforts are being maintained by the technical teams who are operating our first 10 nanosatellites in flight and will be managing the positioning of the 5 new ones. This delicate operation is supported by the precision injection of our satellites into their positions by Rocket Lab's Electron launcher. In addition to IoT, we're delighted to announce the launch of a new service, satellite AIS, dedicated to the global maritime domain, a highly reliable sovereign offer, available in 2025. Ready for launch!”

The mission is one of several Electron launches scheduled for lift-off before the end of the year, with 12 Electron launches already completed successfully in 2024, making this Rocket Lab’s busiest launch year to date.
