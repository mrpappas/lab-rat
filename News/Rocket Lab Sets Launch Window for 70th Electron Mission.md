Long Beach, Calif. August 18, 2025: Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it is scheduled to launch its next dedicated mission on Electron this weekend. The mission is scheduled to lift off less than three weeks after Electron’s previous mission and marks the Company’s 70 <sup>th</sup> Electron launch to date.

Named “Live, Laugh, Launch,” the mission is scheduled for launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand no earlier than August 23, 2025 UTC to deploy five satellites to a 655km circular Earth orbit for a confidential commercial customer.

This latest mission on Electron’s 2025 launch manifest underscores its ability to provide responsive space access for small satellite customers with a range of mission requirements. As the world’s most frequently launched small-lift orbital rocket, Electron continues to break its own launch cadence records that set the precedent for repeatable, reliable space access globally.

Rocket Lab’s 70 <sup>th</sup> Electron mission comes just days before the highly-anticipated official opening of its new launch site, Launch Complex 3, for its upcoming Neutron rocket – a medium-lift, reusable rocket that will launch from Wallops Island, Virginia. The Company continues to execute a busy schedule of Electron launches while preparing to debut Neutron.
