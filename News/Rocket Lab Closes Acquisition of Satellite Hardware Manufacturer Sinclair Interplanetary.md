**Rocket Lab Closes Acquisition of Satellite Hardware Manufacturer Sinclair Interplanetary** 

*The acquisition solidifies Rocket Lab’s position as the leading space systems company for end-to end small satellite mission solutions*

**LONG BEACH, Calif. 30 April 2020** – Rocket Lab, a leading space systems company, has closed the transaction to acquire Sinclair Interplanetary, a leading provider of high-quality, flight-proven satellite hardware.

Rocket Lab announced the execution of the agreement to acquire Sinclair Interplanetary on March 16, 2020 pending customary closing conditions and satisfying The Investment Canada Act review process. Terms of the approved deal were not disclosed.

The acquisition strengthens the satellite division of Rocket Lab, which produces the [Photon spacecraft line](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/satellites/). Sinclair Interplanetary products will become key features of Rocket Lab’s Photon satellite platforms designed for low Earth orbit, lunar, and interplanetary small satellite missions. Rocket Lab will also dedicate resources to grow Sinclair’s already strong merchant spacecraft components business. The acquisition enables Sinclair Interplanetary to tap into Rocket Lab’s resources, scale, manufacturing capability, and innovative technologies to make world-leading satellite hardware accessible to more customers.

Both companies have built leading space businesses with consistent strong revenue growth and together, Rocket Lab and Sinclair Interplanetary will provide the small satellite industry with optimized spacecraft solutions and cohesive launch services to make space easy.

“When we talk to small satellite operators across the board their challenges are clear: They need to get on orbit faster; they need proven and reliable hardware; and they need the ability to focus on their core business, rather than spending years tied up in hardware development. Rocket Lab and Sinclair Interplanetary are uniquely suited to solve these challenges and make space easy for our customers,” said Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and CEO.

"At Sinclair Interplanetary we’ve had the privilege of serving the small satellite community for almost 20 years across diverse and innovative missions,” said Doug Sinclair, founder of Sinclair Interplanetary. “We’re excited to build on our strong heritage by combining the capabilities of Rocket Lab and Sinclair Interplanetary to scale manufacturing, make our hardware available to more customers globally, and be able to supply larger constellations than ever before.”

Founded in 2001 by Doug Sinclair, Toronto-based Sinclair Interplanetary develops reliable, best-in-class spacecraft hardware, including reaction wheels and star trackers that support rapid-schedule small satellite programs. More than 90 satellites incorporating Sinclair hardware have been launched to orbit, including Rocket Lab-launched satellites from AstroDigital, ALE, and BlackSky. The Sinclair team has been entrusted with developing hardware for world-first missions including BRITE, the world’s smallest space telescope, and The Planetary Society’s LightSail 2, the first satellite in Earth orbit to be propelled solely by sunlight. Satellite communications company, Kepler Communications, has also selected Sinclair reaction wheels for its constellation of 140 Internet of Things satellites currently in development.

Sinclair Interplanetary will continue to be led by Doug Sinclair and the company will maintain its team and facilities in Toronto, Canada. In addition to being incorporated into Rocket Lab’s Photon satellite line, Sinclair Interplanetary hardware will remain available to satellite operators building their own spacecraft.
