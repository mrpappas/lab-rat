Long Beach, California. May 6, 2024. – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has completed the selection of subcontractors to provide payloads and ground systems for the 18 satellites the Company is developing for SDA (Space Development Agency).

Rocket Lab is the prime contractor for a $515 million USD firm-fixed price agreement to lead the design, development, production, test, and operations of 18 satellites for SDA’s Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta (T2TL - Beta) as part of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). The PWSA is a layered low-Earth orbit satellite constellation designed to deliver secure, low-latency communications and missile tracking capabilities for the U.S. Department of Defense.

The 18 satellites being developed by Rocket Lab will integrate subsystems and components built in-house by the Company, including solar panels, structures, star trackers, reaction wheels, radio, flight software, avionics, and launch dispensers. As prime contractor, Rocket Lab also leads the procurement and integration of the payloads and other subsystems and has selected the following companies as subcontractors to support the program.

CesiumAstro: An industry leader in active phased array communications technology for space and airborne systems, CesiumAstro will provide its Vireo active electronically scanned array (AESA) radio frequency (RF) communications payload. The payload will be the first multi-beam-capable Ka-band communications system operating in SDA’s PWSA.

Mynaric: A leading provider of free space optical communications terminals for air, space and mobile applications, Mynaric has been selected to provide CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals.

SEAKR Engineering: SEAKR, a leading supplier of advanced payload and mission solutions, has been selected to provide the Tactical Satellite Communications (TACSATCOM) Software Defined Radio (SDR) and  Network  Encryption System (NES).

Collins Aerospace: Collins Aerospace will be providing the waveform for the SDR, which is the software and firmware required to transmit and receive TACSATCOM.

Redwire Space: Redwire Space, a global leader in space infrastructure, has been selected to provide antennas and RF hardware.

Parsons Corporation: Parsons will be supplying the NEBULA Operations – Vendor Architecture (NOVA) which will be Rocket Lab’s ground system for managing operations for its 18 satellites.

“Rocket Lab has a strong history of developing highly capable, resilient, and affordable space infrastructure. We’re excited to continue this heritage by delivering a reliable satellite constellation to SDA in support of PWSA,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck. “Rocket Lab technology has been delivering mission success in orbit for more than 20 years, so when we look for subcontractors to support our programs we select for performance and proven experience – something this hand-picked team has in abundance.”
