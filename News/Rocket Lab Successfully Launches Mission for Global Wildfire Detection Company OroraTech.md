*From contract to launch in just four months, Rocket Lab successfully deploys eight satellites for wildfire detection mission.*

**Mahia, New Zealand. March 27, 2025** – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its latest mission within four months of contract signing for Germany-based global wildfire and detection company OroraTech.

The ‘Finding Hot Wildfires Near You’ mission lifted-off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1, Pad B, in Mahia, New Zealand at 4:30 am on 26 March NZDT (15:30 UTC), successfully deploying eight satellites to a 550 km circular low Earth orbit. The mission was Rocket Lab’s fifth launch of 2025 and 63 <sup>rd</sup> launch overall, bringing the total count of satellites deployed by Electron to 224. Twenty-one of those satellites have been deployed in Q1 2025 alone: a testament to Rocket Lab’s global leadership in dedicated small launch. ‘Finding Hot Wildfires Near You’ launched within four months since contract signing in order to meet the time-sensitive requirements of OroraTech’s wildfire detection mission.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck said: “This launch is yet another showcase of the exceptional qualities of Electron and the Rocket Lab team: a quick and streamlined turnaround to get this important mission in space, precise deployment for optimal global wildfire monitoring, and responsive service that perfectly meets customer requirements. I'm proud of the team's consistent performance as we aim for another record-breaking year in launch with Electron.”

‘Finding Hot Wildfires Near You’ marked a significant expansion of OroraTech’s constellation, enhancing their global capabilities and connectivity with a network of advanced thermal sensors. This development enables continuous real-time monitoring of wildfires and hotspots, providing critical foresight and support to first responders, governments, and those invested in protecting people, infrastructure, the economy, and the environment.

‘Finding Hot Wildfires Near You’ is the third Electron launch completed within two weeks from Launch Complex 1, showcasing the Company’s increased launch cadence as Rocket Lab targets 20+ Electron launches in 2025. Upcoming missions include the next launches in multi-launch contracts to build constellations in space for Synspective, iQPS, and BlackSky, and launches of Rocket Lab’s Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron (HASTE) for hypersonic technology advancement from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia.
