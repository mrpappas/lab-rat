*The Stronger Together mission, Rocket Lab’s 34<sup>th</sup> Electron launch, will deliver two Earth observation satellites to low Earth orbit for Capella Space*

Rocket Lab USA, Inc (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, today announced it has scheduled its next Electron launch from Virginia during a launch window that opens March 11, 2023.

The “Stronger Together” mission is scheduled to launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 (LC-2) on Wallops Island, Virginia for American space tech company Capella Space, a leading provider of commercial Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The mission will be Rocket Lab’s second launch from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility following from the Company’s successful inaugural mission from LC-2 on January 24, 2023.

“Stronger Together” will deploy two 100-kg class satellites to low Earth orbit and expand the existing Capella Space SAR constellation, increasing imaging capacity to meet growing customer demand. Capella Space SAR satellites can gather images of Earth any time of day, in any weather and penetrate conditions including clouds, fog, smog, darkness and smoke. Supporting Rocket Lab’s vertical integration strategy, Rocket Lab will also supply Capella Space with two of the Company’s own Motorized Lightbands; separation systems designed to separate the Capella satellites from Electron once in orbit. Rocket Lab has launched for Capella previously with the “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Optical” mission in August 2020, when Electron successfully deployed to orbit Capella’s first satellite in its SAR constellation.

This upcoming launch is one of five missions for Capella Space scheduled to start launching on Electron this year, following the [recently-announced multi-launch deal](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20230301005140%2Fen%2FRocket-Lab-Signs-Multi-Launch-Deal-to-Deploy-Satellite-Constellation-for-Capella-Space&esheet=53357328&newsitemid=20230307005394&lan=en-US&anchor=recently-announced+multi-launch+deal&index=1&md5=a5f9127bdb042ea90d34eb903efd2339) securing four rapid succession launches for Capella from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand. However, there is the option for Capella to move any of these missions to Launch Complex 2 should that be needed to meet Capella’s requirements – the type of responsive and flexible launch solution that Rocket Lab can provide by operating three orbital launch pads across two continents.

Members of the public wanting to watch Electron’s upcoming launch from Virginia can visit nearby viewing locations in Accomack County, Virginia, such as Robert Reed Park and Curtis Merrit Harbor on Chincoteague Island. The Virginia, Maryland and Delaware Atlantic beaches also provide good viewing locations.
