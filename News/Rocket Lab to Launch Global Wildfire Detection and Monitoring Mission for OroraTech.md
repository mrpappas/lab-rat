## Rocket Lab to Launch Global Wildfire Detection and Monitoring Mission for OroraTech

*Rocket Lab will launch a dedicated Electron mission for first time customer OroraTech, helping to play a crucial role in protecting against wildfires globally* 

Long Beach, California. 22 January, 2025. – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has signed a contract for a responsive launch on Electron with [Orora Technologies](https://ororatech.com/) (OroraTech), a German company developing a satellite constellation to monitor wildfires and alert first responders to danger. 

Launching from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand, the dedicated mission on Electron will deploy eight satellites to a 550km orbit within just four months from launch contract signing, enabling OroraTech to meet the season-sensitive requirements of its wildfire detection mission. The rapid turnaround is just the latest demonstration of Rocket Lab’s responsive launch capabilities for satellite operators needing urgent access to space.

OroraTech is developing a constellation of satellites with thermal infrared cameras that can provide 24/7 monitoring of wildfires globally, supporting better and faster wildfire response to protect forests, people, and infrastructure worldwide. The mission will deploy its latest plane of satellites called OTC-P1 to their current constellation, further expanding OroraTech’s capabilities to first responders, governments, and industry partners. The company will expand their constellation with up to 100 satellites in total by 2028. 

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “This launch is a showcase of all the benefits of flying dedicated on Electron: control over schedule, agility and ability to meet tight deadlines and mission requirements, and the reliability of launching on the world’s most frequently launched small orbital rocket. Knowing that time is of the essence to get these satellites in space, we’re proud to be rising to the challenge and supporting the OroraTech mission to better monitor for and protect against these devastating natural disasters globally.” 

The mission is the latest launch to be announced in a packed 2025 launch manifest for Rocket Lab that includes the continuation of multi-launch contracts with constellation operators Synspective, Kineis, and BlackSky;; a responsive space mission for the U.S. Space Force that will see Rocket Lab build a spacecraft, then launch it on Electron with 24-hours’ notice; and the debut launch of Rocket Lab’s new medium-lift reusable rocket, Neutron.
