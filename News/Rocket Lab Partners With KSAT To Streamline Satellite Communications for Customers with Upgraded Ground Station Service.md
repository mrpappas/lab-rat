*The new ground station service streamlines operations for Rocket Lab customers’ across a wide variety of missions – from satellite deorbit and re-entry missions to launches on Neutron for interplanetary missions.* 

**Small Sat Conference. Logan, Utah. August 06, 2024.** – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, has partnered with Kongsberg Satellite Services ([[KSAT]]), a world leading provider of communication services for spacecraft and launch vehicles, to develop a new global ground station service for its operations and customers that enables efficient and reliable communications for future Neutron launches, increasingly ambitious Electron launches, and on-orbit operations, spacecraft deorbit, and return-to-Earth missions with Rocket Lab spacecraft.

Rocket Lab’s Electron launch vehicle is one of the world’s most frequently launched rockets, having successfully delivered 191 satellites to space for government and commercial customers across science and exploration missions, Earth observation, weather monitoring, and national security. Further expanding its launch capabilities, Rocket Lab is developing its new medium-lift reusable rocket Neutron to launch constellations of satellites, national security and defense missions, and interplanetary missions from mid-2025. Rocket Lab also designs, builds, launches, and operates spacecraft for a variety of government and commercial satellite operators, enabling missions to the Moon for NASA, and providing in-space operations, deorbit, and return-to-Earth spacecraft re-entry operations for commercial customers like Varda Space Industries.

With preparations for Neutron’s first launch, additional return-to-Earth spacecraft missions scheduled for Varda, and more than 40 satellites in the Company’s backlog, Rocket Lab has worked closely with KSAT to co-engineer a new satellite communications service that meets the critical requirements of these future missions. As the sole provider of ground station services to Rocket Lab, KSAT’s network has been scaled to meet both Rocket Lab’s launch and spacecraft operations and the demands of the space industry to ensure optimal performance, minimal latency, and robust support throughout the mission lifecycle.

The expanded satellite communications service now available to KSAT’s and Rocket Lab’s customers includes unique antenna tracking features for complex mission designs across a global ground station network of more than 200 antennas; real-time telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C); extended monitoring, control, and data acquisition capabilities in S-band, X-band, and Ka-band supporting key IRIG-106 modulation codes; automated ground station scheduling for satellite passes; and other upgraded features and benefits.

Rocket Lab’s Vice President, Business Development & Strategy, Space Systems, Richard French, says: “This upgraded satellite communications service for Electron and Neutron launches and across our various spacecraft streamlines our customers’ missions and simplifies their access to space/ Satellite operators can outsource their satellite operations and communications to us, allowing them to focus on their mission at hand rather than having to build and operate their own ground station infrastructure. We’re delighted to be able to ensure our customers benefit from a reliable, scalable service through our ongoing partnership  with KSAT.

KSAT’s Director of Ground Network Products, Arthur Merlin, says: “Partnering with Rocket Lab exemplifies our commitment to advancing ground network technology through strategic collaborations. This partnership leverages the strengths of both organizations, ensuring seamless and reliable communications for our customers worldwide. We are excited to work closely with Rocket Lab, a leader in innovative launch solutions, to enhance our service offerings and drive forward the development of space communication.”

Additionally, Rocket Lab offers technical and regulatory services as part of its streamlined end-to-end mission solution for customers, including support with radio licensing, frequency coordination to manage unwanted interference, and process navigation through the most complex regulatory environments, as well as a range of technical support services.
