Hawke’s Bay students interested in becoming innovators, scientists, and engineers, are being offered the opportunity to pursue STEM education thanks to Rocket Lab’s 2019 tertiary scholarship.

Applications are now open for the annual Rocket Lab Scholarship, which offers $20,000 across four years of study one outstanding undergraduate student each year. The scholarship also provides students with hands-on mentorship towards the end of their degree from leading space and engineering experts at Rocket Lab.

The Rocket Lab scholarship is open to students with a strong connection to Māhia and the wider Wairoa District in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand, who can also demonstrate involvement in cultural, community, or leadership activities.

Previous Rocket Lab scholars include Arianna Ormond, who is pursuing a degree in computing and mathematical sciences, and Mya Mataki-Wilson, who is studying towards a career as a civil or chemical and bioprocess engineer.

Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, says it has been great to see the two Rocket Lab scholars to date thriving in their degrees and pursing their dream careers in STEM.

“Fostering a diverse talent pool of next-generation innovators and engineers is incredibly important for New Zealand. The demand for savvy and capable problem-solvers in STEM is increasing – not just here, but also globally - and opportunities are boundless for students with the passion and dedication to pursue their ideas. We’re thrilled to be encouraging and enabling students from regional New Zealand to pursue careers in STEM.,” says Mr. Beck.

The Rocket Lab Scholarship was founded in 2017 to directly support the community surrounding Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 on the Māhia Peninsula. It is designed to foster continued excellence and innovation amongst New Zealand’s next generation of science, technology, mathematics and engineering leaders. Applications for the annual scholarship open in term three each year at rocketlabusa.com.
