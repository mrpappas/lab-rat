The launch is the first step in validating the technology behind E-Space’s mesh network of secure communication satellites designed to make space affordable and accessible.

Long Beach, California. March 21, 2021 – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: RKLB), a global leader in launch services, space systems and space solar power products, announced today it will launch three demonstration satellites for E-Space, to validate the systems and technology for its satellite system.

The satellites are scheduled to fly as part of a rideshare mission on Rocket Lab’s Electron launch vehicle from Launch Complex 1 Pad A on New Zealand’s Mahia Peninsula expected in the second quarter of 2022.

E-Space aims to reduce the launch requirements for a full constellation to months instead of years — decreasing the time it takes to scale, replenish or deliver a full system. E-Space’s system aims to allow governments and companies to own private satellite constellations that can dynamically scale in capabilities, with applications ranging from secure communications to managing remote infrastructure, while maintaining a high level of security, flexibility and resiliency.

“Our first satellites will provide a demonstration and test platform for our new sustainable satellite system,” said Greg Wyler, founder and CEO of E-Space. “E-Space will increase the speed for constellation delivery from years to months, allowing new opportunities for more people to access space-based platforms. With the help of Rocket Lab, we are excited to be bringing these satellites into orbit in record time.”

“We’re excited to partner with E-Space on their first mission,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck. “Innovation is the key to success in space, and E-Space’s commitment to reducing the time it takes to create a constellation or satellies, while maintaining affordability and accessibilty falls in line with our own values at Rocket Lab, as we have done with Electron, the leading small launch vehicle. We wish them enomous success in their mission with us.”
