**Long Beach, California.** Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has been selected to launch two dedicated missions on Electron for a confidential commercial customer, the first of which will launch in just four days’ time - a demonstration of Rocket Lab’s ability to execute against a rapid contract-to-launch timeline for responsive, dedicated access to space for satellite operators.

Launching from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand, the first dedicated mission on Electron – named “Symphony In The Stars” - will take place no earlier than June 20, 2025 to deploy a single spacecraft to a 650km circular Earth orbit. A second dedicated launch on Electron to meet those same mission requirements is scheduled for launch before the end of 2025.

Rocket Lab Founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “These newly-added missions to our launch manifest represent everything that makes Electron a global launch leader: a tailored and responsive launch service that meets the mission requirements of satellite operators to get their satellites on orbit when they want, where they want, and on short notice. We’re proud to be delivering an unbeatable launch service for this new customer on Electron and looking forward to the first launch this week.”

These dedicated Electron launches demonstrate both the strength of Rocket Lab’s responsive launch capabilities and its increasing launch cadence as the global leader in dedicated small launch. With demand for 20+ launches in 2025 and 100% mission success for all Electron launches this year, Electron is continually sought after by satellite operators across commercial, civil, and government missions, and remains on track for another record year of launches from Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 and Launch Complex 2 orbital launch sites in Mahia, New Zealand and Wallops Island, Virginia.
