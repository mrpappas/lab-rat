**Long Beach, Calif. December 17, 2024** – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, has successfully delivered its second Pioneer spacecraft to Vandenberg Space Force Base and completed production and testing of a third for Varda Space Industries, Inc. (“Varda”), the world's first orbital pharmaceutical processing and hypersonic Earth re-entry logistics company.

The two spacecraft are part of a [four-vehicle contract](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-inks-deal-with-varda-space-industries-to-supply-multiple-photon-spacecraft-for-space-manufacturing-missions/) between Rocket Lab and Varda, aimed at revolutionizing commercial manufacturing in space. Designed, built, and tested at Rocket Lab’s state-of-the-art Spacecraft Production Complex in Long Beach, California, the [Pioneer platform](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/space-systems/spacecraft/) serves as the enabler of Varda’s innovative missions.

Rocket Lab’s Pioneer platform hosts Varda’s reentry capsule, which leverages microgravity conditions to conduct operations in space that are difficult or impossible on Earth. Rocket Lab’s Pioneer spacecraft provides essential systems for power, communications, propulsion, and attitude control for Varda’s 120kg reentry capsule. To enable Varda’s operations and safely return the capsule to Earth, the Pioneer spacecraft maneuvers the capsule into the precise position and sets it on a course for reentry. Rocket Lab also provides critical mission operations support for launch, commissioning, operation and reentry of the spacecraft. The first Pioneer spacecraft Rocket Lab developed for Varda was launched in 2023 and spent eight months on orbit, successfully enabling the growth of crystals of the HIV/AIDS-treating drug ritonavir inside Varda’s capsule. The capsule was successfully deorbited and landed in the Utah desert in February 2024.

For Varda’s second mission, scheduled for launch in Q1 of 2025, Rocket Lab and Varda will once again conduct in-space operations, reentry positioning maneuvers, but this time deorbit the spacecraft over Australia and land Varda’s capsule at the Koonibba Test Range in South Australia.

Rocket Lab’s ability to complete production and testing of a third spacecraft for Varda less than two months after [completion of the second](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-completes-second-spacecraft-for-varda-space-industries-advancing-in-space-manufacturing/) is testament to the Company’s vertical integration strategy and recent scaling of satellite production capability. By vertically integrating design, component manufacturing, satellite integration and testing, Rocket Lab has optimized schedule and cost efficiency in satellite production.

“We’re setting a new standard for rapid, reliable satellite production,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. “Each Pioneer spacecraft for Varda’s missions is a perfect demonstration of our growing capability as an end-to-end space company that delivers design, manufacturing, integration, testing, launch support and in-space operations to get our customers’ innovative ideas on orbit quickly and cost effectively.” 

"This mission is another step toward high cadence reentry," said Varda CEO and co-founder Will Bruey. "Soon, reentry will be as common as launch."
