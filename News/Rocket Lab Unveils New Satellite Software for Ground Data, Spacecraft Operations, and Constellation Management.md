Long Beach, Calif. March 12, 2025 – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced InterMission and MAX Constellation, two next-generation software suites that build on successful missions to the Moon and beyond to deliver advanced autonomy, security, and scalability for complex space missions and constellation operations. The new platforms were introduced at the SATELLITE conference in Washington, D.C.

Backed by over 250 cumulative years of on-orbit flight heritage, Rocket Lab’s proven space software powers every stage of a mission—from launch and spacecraft commissioning to operations and data management. The Company’s flight software has been used on commercial and government programs like NASA’s CAPSTONE mission, Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost 1, Varda Space Industries’ W 1 and W 2 series missions, DARPA’s Blackjack Program, and more.

With InterMission and MAX Constellation, Rocket Lab expands its end-to-end space, systems capabilities, delivering robust tools for modern mission demands. InterMission is Rocket Lab’s new ground data and space operations platform built for demanding missions and scalable to full constellations. Designed to maximize performance and autonomy, InterMission empowers users to monitor their spacecraft in real-time and record telemetry, unlocking mission insights through custom data transformations and staying informed with tailored alarms and notifications. With security at its core, InterMission integrates encryption, user authentication, and role-based access control to safeguard mission-critical data.

MAX Constellation is an evolution of Rocket Lab’s MAX Flight Software, the industry-leader in on-board software that has been proven in every orbit and to the surface of the moon.  MAX Constellation builds on this success by delivering enhanced performance, automation, and cybersecurity for constellation-class programs. MAX Constellation includes ODySSy, Rocket Lab’s powerful digital twin platform, providing high-fidelity simulations of spacecraft components, dynamics, and environments.  
  
MAX Constellation and InterMission are also available for the Beyond Gravity Constellation On-Board Computer (cOBC), a collaborative offering that simplifies satellite operations as an off-the-shelf integrated solution combining avionics, flight software, and ground operations  in one package.

“InterMission and MAX Constellation strengthen Rocket Lab’s industry-leading space software suite, giving our customers the tools to optimize performance, reduce risk, and maximize mission success,” said Brad Clevenger, Vice President, Rocket Lab Space Systems.
