*The mission, Rocket Lab’s ninth launch for BlackSky overall, will launch from Rocket Lab [[Launch Complex 1]] in New Zealand in February.*

**Long Beach, Calif. February 10, 2025**: Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it will soon launch a satellite on a dedicated [[Electron]] mission, the first of a bulk order of multiple new missions for real-time space-based intelligence company [[BlackSky]] (NYSE: [BSKY](https://ir.blacksky.com/)).

The mission, named “Fasten Your Space Belts”, will launch from Rocket Lab’s private orbital launch site, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1, in New Zealand during a launch window that opens on February 18<sup>th</sup> UTC. The mission will launch the first Gen-3 satellite in BlackSky’s mid-inclination, Earth-imaging constellation to a circular 470km orbit. The mission is the ninth launch for BlackSky since 2019, making Rocket Lab the most prolific launch provider for BlackSky’s constellation to date.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir [[Peter Beck]], says: “Electron is a trusted and reliable constellation builder for companies like BlackSky, allowing them to be in control of how, when, and where to deploy their constellation. BlackSky is one of our earliest and longest-standing commercial satellite customers, and it’s great to be heading back to the pad with them once again to continue to advance and expand their constellation.”

“This launch represents a major inflection point for our global defense and intelligence customer base as BlackSky introduces low-latency, very high-resolution Gen-3 satellite to our dynamic, high-frequency monitoring constellation,” said Brian O’Toole, BlackSky CEO. “As more Gen-3 satellites complete production, we expect a regular cadence of additional launches over the coming year.”

The mission will bring the total number of satellites delivered to space by Rocket Lab to 210 and follows a record year of 16 successful launches 2024. Each mission for BlackSky includes a Rocket Lab Motorized Lightband separation system for BlackSky’s satellites, demonstrating Rocket Lab’s vertical integration strategy and ability to provide commercial launch, satellite, and spacecraft components solutions across the mission spectrum.

“Fasten Your Space Belts” will be Rocket Lab’s second mission of 2025 and its 60<sup>th</sup> Electron launch overall. Rocket Lab’s 2025 launch manifest includes Electron missions for commercial and government customers, as well as HASTE missions from Launch Complex 2. Launch windows for each will be announced in due course.
