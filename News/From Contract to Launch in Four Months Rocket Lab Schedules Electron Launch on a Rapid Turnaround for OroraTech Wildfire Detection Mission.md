**Long Beach, Calif. March 18, 2025**: Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has scheduled a rapid turnaround mission on Electron for OroraTech, a Germany-based global provider of wildfire detection and monitoring solutions.                   
The mission, named “Finding Hot Wildfires Near You”, is set to launch during a window that opens on March 27<sup>th</sup> UTC and will lift off from Rocket Lab’s private orbital launch site Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. The mission is being deployed only four months after the launch contract was signed to support OroraTech’s season-sensitive requirements for its wildfire detection mission.

Electron will deliver eight of OroraTech’s Constellation Phase 1 satellites to a 550km orbit to expand its constellation providing data from space to help tackle wildfire challenges globally. Using AI-driven analytics derived from near-real-time data provided by its satellites’ thermal infrared cameras, OroraTech’s constellation empowers first responders, governments and those alike with the ability to swiftly address wildfires and hotspots worldwide, significantly enhancing the protection of people, forests, and infrastructure.

“Finding Hot Wildfires Near You" will be Rocket Lab's fifth mission of 2025 and 63<sup>rd</sup> Electron launch overall, and will bring the total number of satellites delivered to space Electron to 224.
