## Notes

- This **Form 10-K/A (Amendment No. 1)** was filed to restate financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, including periods as of September 30, 2020. The restatement pertains to the classification of warrants as derivative liabilities rather than equity components, following updated SEC guidance for SPACs.
- The amendment concludes that outstanding warrants were incorrectly classified due to provisions impacting settlement amounts based on holder characteristics and tender offer provisions. Consequently, the warrants are subject to re-measurement at each reporting period, with changes reflected in the statement of operations.
- No impact was reported on previously disclosed operating expenses, cash flows, or cash.

### Highlights:

- The registrant, Vector Acquisition Corporation, is a SPAC established on July 28, 2020, to facilitate a business combination.
- Recent developments include an agreement to merge with **Rocket Lab USA, Inc.** as part of its initial business combination.
- **PIPE Financing** was arranged, with PIPE investors agreeing to purchase 46,700,000 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share for gross proceeds of $467 million.
