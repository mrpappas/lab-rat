## Mission Details 

Rocket Lab is sending the first private mission to Venus in search of supporting evidence of organic compounds in the cloud layer - traces of life. The goal, using an Electron launch vehicle and Photon spacecraft, is to send a probe to around 30 milesâ€™ altitude, where Venusâ€™ atmospheric conditions are closer to those found on Earth.

While more than 30 Venus missions have been undertaken, Rocket Labâ€™s will be the first private exploration of the planet.

## Probe

**Heat Shield**: HEET is a textured material covering the bottom of the capsule, a woven heat shield designed to protect spacecraft from temperatures up to 4,500 degrees Fahrenheit (2482 degrees Celsius).

**Instrumentation**: [AutoFluorescence Nephelometer (AFN)](https://www.morningstarmissions.space/rocketlabmissiontovenus#comp-m40b759n)

**Mission Life**: ~5 Minutes

**Scientific Output**: Detect and derive particle size and number density, derive complex reflective index, quantify asphericity of particles, and detect fluorescence from particles.
