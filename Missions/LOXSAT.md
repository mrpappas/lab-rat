## Mission Details

**Customer:** [[Space Development Agency (SDA)]]

In 2020, Rocket Lab was selected by [[Eta Space]] to use [[Electron]] and [[Photon]] to conduct a flight demonstration of a complete cryogenic fluid management (CFM) system in orbit for [[NASA]]. The spacecraft, known as **LOXSAT-1**, is being flown under NASA’s [Tipping Point program](https://newspaceeconomy.ca/2024/05/03/nasas-tipping-point-program-fostering-commercial-space-innovation/) to advance cryogenic propellant technologies that could eventually enable long-duration human space exploration.  

The mission will **build, launch, and test a cryogenic fuel depot in low Earth orbit**, evaluating the ability to store and transfer liquid oxygen (LOX) without boil-off. Over a ~9-month mission, LOXSAT will demonstrate active cryogenic thermal control and docking/transfer technologies, collecting critical data to support the development of future orbital propellant depots.

## Spacecraft

### LOXSAT-1

#### Summary  

LOXSAT-1 is a small-scale cryogenic technology demonstrator, mounted on a Rocket Lab [[Photon]] satellite bus. It is designed to collect critical CFM data in orbit while testing **10 different cryogenic fluid management technologies** required to make orbital propellant depots feasible.

#### Payload  

The primary payload is a **spherical liquid oxygen (LOX) tank** integrated with a complete cryogenic fluid management (CFM) system. The tank and hardware are designed to demonstrate **zero-boil-off storage** and **on-orbit transfer of LOX**.  

Key payload elements include:  
- **Propellant Management Device (PMD):** Keeps LOX settled and properly oriented in microgravity.  
- **Cryocooler + Heat Exchanger:** Removes thermal energy from the system to prevent boil-off, enabling long-term storage.  
- **Positive Displacement Pump:** Pressurizes and circulates liquid oxygen during transfer tests.  
- **Spray-Bar Injector:** Mixes subcooled fluid into the tank to reduce ullage pressure and bulk liquid temperature.  
- **Docking & Transfer Interfaces:** Flight-rated cryogenic disconnects to demonstrate repeated mating/de-mating and fluid transfer.  

Together, these systems will validate the ability to **store, chill, and move cryogenic propellants in orbit**, a critical milestone toward creating operational propellant depots for future human and robotic exploration missions.

## Objectives

LOXSAT-1 will test a range of technologies and collect engineering data needed to enable long-term cryogenic propellant storage and transfer in orbit:  

✅ **Zero-boil-off storage:** Demonstrate cryocooler and thermal control systems that prevent propellant loss over extended durations.  
✅ **Fluid transfer operations:** Use flight-qualified cryogenic disconnects to test repeated docking, undocking, and transfer cycles.  
✅ **Propellant conditioning:** Validate the ability to subcool liquid oxygen and manage tank ullage pressure through spray-bar mixing.  
✅ **Microgravity management:** Employ a propellant management device (PMD) to keep cryogenic liquid stable and available for transfer in low-gravity conditions.  
✅ **System integration:** Evaluate performance of combined cryogenic subsystems (tank, pump, heat exchanger, injectors) on an operational smallsat platform.  

## Cryo-Dock

After proving key CFM technologies on LOXSAT, [[Eta Space]] engineers will use the data and lessons learned to create a fully commercial orbiting propellant depot called Cryo-Dock. This depot will have a standardized, agnostic interface to provide reservicing of cryogenic upper stages and orbital transfer vehicles in cis-lunar space.
