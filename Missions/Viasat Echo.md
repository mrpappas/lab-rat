## Mission Details

**Customer**: [[Viasat]]

As a part of NASA's [Communications Services Project (CSP)](https://www.nasa.gov/communicating-with-missions/communications-services-project/), Viasat Inc. was awarded a $53.3 million contract to demonstrate a commercial radio frequency Ka-band relay network that can provide high and low-rate communications services to spacecraft in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Viasat chose Rocket Lab to supply the [[Pioneer]] satellite bus and ground systems support for the mission.

## Objectives

âœ… Demonstrate Ka-band real-time data relay from LEO through Viasatâ€™s GEO satellite network using the RTSR terminal.
âœ… Validate L-band TT&C services using Viasatâ€™s InCommand system and Rocket Labâ€™s new Frontier L-band radio.
âœ… Prove end-to-end integration with Viasatâ€™s Integrated Space Access Network (ISAN), showing adaptive routing across Ka-, L-, S-, and X-bands.
âœ…  NASA CSP goals of commercializing near-Earth comms as the TDRSS system is phased out.

## Mission  Phases

1. Launch & Commissioning
	Deploy into LEO via TBD launcher; bus checkout, power-up, and comms validation using Rocket Lab subsystems.

2. Relay Operations Demo
	Conduct live Ka-band relay via RTSR and GEO network; validate low-latency, high-throughput data links.

3. TT&C Demonstration
	Demonstrate persistent telemetry, tracking, and command using L-band InCommand and new Frontier radio.

4. Direct-to-Ground Validation
	Utilize Viasatâ€™s Real-Time Earth (RTE) ground stations across S-, X-, and Ka-bands to test hybrid transport.

5. System Integration & Flex Testing
	Evaluate routing, throughput, and cost balancing through ISAN with simulated mission operations.
