NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 is a service-based, firm-fixed-price IDIQ contract structure under the [[U.S. Space Force]] designed for low-to-medium risk national security space missions. It supports flexible, task-order-based acquisitions intended to encourage competition, innovation, and rapid integration of emerging commercial launch providers. Lane 1 is open to multiple vendors and targets missions such as rideshares, small-to-medium payloads, or those with less stringent timelines or assurance requirements. It runs in parallel with Lane 2, which is reserved for high-assurance, critical missions with more demanding technical and schedule needs.
