>The OneWeb Constellation is a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite network designed to provide global broadband internet coverage. Comprising hundreds of operational satellites at approximately 1,200 km altitude, the constellation operates in polar orbits to ensure low-latency connectivity across remote and underserved regions. Utilizing Ka-band and Ku-band radio frequencies, OneWeb enables high-speed data transfer for applications in aerospace, maritime, enterprise, and government sectors. The network employs inter-satellite links and gateway stations to optimize coverage and reduce dependence on terrestrial infrastructure. Designed as an alternative to fiber-based connectivity, OneWeb competes with Starlink and Telesat Lightspeed in the emerging LEO broadband market.
