## Mission Details 

Customer: [[Airbus]], [[Eutelsat Group]]

The OneWeb Constellation is a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite network designed to provide global broadband internet coverage. Comprising hundreds of operational satellites at approximately 1,200 km altitude, the constellation operates in polar orbits to ensure low-latency connectivity across remote and underserved regions. Utilizing Ka-band and Ku-band radio frequencies, OneWeb enables high-speed data transfer for applications in aerospace, maritime, enterprise, and government sectors. The network employs inter-satellite links and gateway stations to optimize coverage and reduce dependence on terrestrial infrastructure. Designed as an alternative to fiber-based connectivity, OneWeb competes with Starlink and Telesat Lightspeed in the emerging LEO broadband market.
## Rocket Lab's Involvement

Rocket Lab was selected by [[Airbus]] to provide space grade solar panels as part of their contract to build out 100 OneWeb [[🌍 Orbits#LEO|LEO]] satellites for [[Eutelsat Group]]. Rocket Lab's contract is for 200 solar panels inclusive of carbon composite panel substrates, solar cells, and photovoltaic assemblies.
