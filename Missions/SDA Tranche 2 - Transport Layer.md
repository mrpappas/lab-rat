**Customer:** [[Space Development Agency (SDA)]]
**Contracted Satellites: 18 [[Space Development Agency (SDA)#T2TL Transport Layer Beta|T2TL Transport Layer Beta]]
## Summary

Tranche 2 of [[SDA Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA)]]. Enhances and replenishes capabilities provided by Tranche 1, increasing the number of satellites to enable near-global stereo coverage for missile warning and tracking. Rocket Lab was awarded a $515m contract to act as prime and deliver 18 Beta variant satellites for the **Transport Layer**.

## Transport Layer

SDA's Transport Layer will provide assured, resilient, low-latency military data and connectivity worldwide to the full range of warfighter platforms. SDA's Transport Layer is envisioned, modeled, and architected as a constellation varying in size from 300 to more than 500 satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) ranging from 750km to 1200km in altitude. With a full constellation, 95% of the locations on the Earth will have at least two satellites in view at any given time while 99% of the locations on the Earth will have at least one satellite in view. This will ensure constant world-wide coverage around the globe. The constellation will be interconnected with Optical Inter-Satellite Links (OISLs) which have significantly increased performance over existing radio frequency crosslinks.
