## Mission Details 

Rocket Lab will launch a mission from [[Launch Complex 2]] in 2025 the [[U.S. Space Force]]'s Space Systems Command (SSC). Named Space Test Program-30 (STP-S-30), the mission will deliver research experiments and technology demonstrations to orbit for the Department of Defense that contribute to future space systems development. The projected primary payload, [[Organization/Partners/The Aerospace Corporation#DiskSat|DiskSat]], will demonstrate sustained very low earth orbit (VLEO) flight and test a unique, 1-meter diameter, disk-shaped satellite bus that is designed to increase on-orbit persistence.

>[!hint] From Gunters

[[The Aerospace Corporation]], with the support of the [NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate](https://www.nasa.gov/space-technology-mission-directorate/) (STMD), is preparing a flight of four [[The Aerospace Corporation#DiskSat|DiskSats]] for launch in 2026 to demonstrate the feasibility of both the dispenser and the DiskSat bus. In addition, the flight is expected to demonstrate several features of the DiskSat including the unprecedented high power-to-mass ratio, the maneuverability of the bus using low-thrust electric propulsion, and the ability to fly continuously in a low-drag orientation, enabling operations in very low Earth orbits (VLEO).

The DiskSats will be launched in and deployed from a dispenser that provides a containerized rideshare environment; the dispenser fully encloses the DiskSats during launch and then opens to dispense the satellites one at a time once in orbit. The dispenser is modular in design and expandable from the capacity of four DiskSats for this flight to as many as 20 DiskSats for future flights. It remains attached to the upper stage.

![[Organization/Partners/The Aerospace Corporation#DiskSat]]

## Objectives

 ✅ **Validate DiskSat Platform:** Demonstrate deployment, power generation, and operations of the new 1-meter disk-shaped satellite bus.  
 ✅ **Dispenser Demonstration:** Test the containerized rideshare dispenser, including sequential deployment of four DiskSats in orbit.  
 ✅ **VLEO Operations:** Assess sustained flight in very low Earth orbit (~200-450 km) using a low-drag attitude profile.  
 ✅ **Electric Propulsion Testing:** Evaluate maneuverability and station-keeping with onboard low-thrust electric propulsion.  
 ✅ **High Power-to-Mass Ratio:** Collect data on DiskSat’s ability to generate >200 W of power within a ~20U equivalent volume.
