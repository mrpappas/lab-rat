>**Customer**: [[U.S. Air Force]]
**Contract Value**: $46 Billion (capped)
**Type**: IDIQ
**Period**: Through 2031
>
>The [AFLCMC Armament Directorate](https://www.aflcmc.af.mil/WELCOME/Organizations/Armament-Directorate/) has rolled out the Enterprise-Wide Agile Acquisition Contract (EWAAC) IDIQ, capped at $46B through 2031. This initiative is designed to rapidly cater to the [AFPEO](https://ww3.safaq.hq.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/430542/about-peocm/)'s weapons requirements, primarily emphasizing Armament and the Digital Trinity. Leveraging the provisions of [FAR part 16.5](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-16#FAR_Subpart_16_5), the goal is to expedite the acquisition process. It's important to note that this contract doesn't have predetermined funding. Instead, it will draw upon funds from both interagency collaborations and external agency allocations, as channeled via the AFPEO Weapons portfolio and supplementary program funds provided.

## Time to Award

One of the primary goals of EWAAC is fast Award Times using [FAR 16.5](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-16#FAR_Subpart_16_5).  RFPs are 'released frequently with awards within three months post release'.

[[#Fair Opportunity Proposal Request (FOPR)|FOPR]] **Average is 81 days** for competitive proposals: **fastest is 31 days**
[[#Fair Opportunity Exception (FOE)|FOE]] -  **Average is 39 days** for sole source proposals: **fastest is 8 days**
### Types of Opportunities

#### Fair¬†Opportunity¬†Proposal¬†Request¬†(FOPR)
A FOPR is the contracting officer‚Äôs formal order‚Äëlevel solicitation under a multiple‚Äëaward IDIQ.¬†It communicates the Government‚Äôs requirement, proposal‚Äëpreparation instructions, applicable evaluation factors (and their relative importance), and any order‚Äëspecific terms, conditions, or clauses.¬†Issuance of a FOPR is the mechanism by which the ordering activity satisfies the ‚Äúfair‚Äëopportunity‚Äù mandate of FAR¬†16.505(b)(1), **ensuring every eligible contract holder can compete for the task or delivery order.**

#### Fair¬†Opportunity¬†Exception¬†(FOE)
An FOE refers to one of the statutory circumstances enumerated at FAR¬†16.505(b)(2)(i)(A)‚Äì(G) (e.g., urgent need, only‚Äëone‚Äëcapable‚Äësource, logical follow‚Äëon, minimum‚Äëguarantee orders, etc.) that **authorizes the contracting officer to restrict or bypass the fair‚Äëopportunity competition among IDIQ holders**.¬†Invoking an FOE requires a written justification that cites the specific paragraph relied upon, obtains the applicable approvals, and is posted in accordance with FAR¬†16.505(b)(2)(ii).

>[!quote] Sir Peter Beck (CEO) on being selected for EWAAC + UK MOD HTCDF
>‚ÄúThe ability to contribute toward the collective security of the United States and the United Kingdom across both of these important programs is a proud moment for the HASTE team, and a demonstration of Rocket Lab‚Äôs commitment to lead from the front when it comes to innovative and unique solutions for hypersonic technology development. Keeping pace with global developments means more affordable tests at a higher rate that expands the boundaries of hypersonic technology - and that‚Äôs a capability we‚Äôre already providing all in one platform with HASTE, at a commercial price and cadence that serves the mission of both nations.‚Äù [Source](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-onramped-to-multi-billion-dollar-u-s-and-u-k-defense-contracts-to-expand-hypersonic-technology-development-with-haste/)
