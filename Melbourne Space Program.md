The Melbourne Space Program is a non-profit organization based in Melbourne, Australia, focused on student-led satellite development and hands-on space systems education. Their key achievements include the ACRUX-1 CubeSat, launched in June 2019 aboard a Rocket Lab Electron, as a demonstration of satellite design and deployment capabilities. Future missions, such as ACRUX-2, aim to build on this success. The program emphasizes practical training in space engineering and systems development for students and early-career professionals.
