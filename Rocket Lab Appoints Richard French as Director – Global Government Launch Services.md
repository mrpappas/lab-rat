The award-winning engineer brings more than a decade of experience at NASA to lead Rocket Lab’s government services in the United States and international markets

Huntington Beach, California – 5 September 2019: Rocket Lab, the global leader in dedicated small satellite launch, has appointed Richard French to the role of Director – Global Government Launch Services. Joining Rocket Lab following 12 years at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Mr. French’s new role will see him focus on providing launch and on-orbit solutions for United States civil space customers such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as international civil space customers.

In his previous role at NASA JPL, Mr. French spent several years as an engineer working across various missions, including the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission (for which he won the NASA Honors Early Career Public Achievement Medal for his work as a lead system engineer) and helping to land the Curiosity Rover on Mars. After moving into a managerial role in the Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA HQ, and then JPL’s Space Technology Office, he made significant contributions in implementing public-private partnerships with companies like Blue Origin, Astrobotic Technology, and Made in Space, and helped stand up NASA’s first start-up accelerator program with Techstars.

The appointment comes at a pivotal time for Rocket Lab as construction of the company’s second launch complex in Virginia nears completion, with the first customer to fly on Electron from the Mid Atlantic Regional Spaceport to be announced in the coming months. Launch Complex 2 in Virginia has been designed specifically for government missions and the site can support up to 12 launches per year. The site adds to the existing launch availability of 120 missions per year from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand.

Rocket Lab is also expanding its services to include on-orbit solutions enabled by its recently announced in-house designed and built satellite bus, Photon. Photon offers custom capabilities for hosted payloads with the ability to remain on orbit for up to five years. The combination of Photon and Electron provides a one-stop-shop experience for customers to efficiently deliver their payloads to orbit.

“Richard’s extensive experience at NASA and his work on commercial and government partnerships made him the obvious choice to lead government services at Rocket Lab,” says Lars Hoffman, Senior Vice President – Global Launch Services. “Rocket Lab is proud to offer frequent, reliable, and streamlined launch services to small satellite operators, and I’m looking forward to seeing Richard expand on Rocket Lab’s premium experience for our government customers.”

Mr. French says: “I’m excited for the opportunity to continue enabling government agency space missions, but this time from the industry side and with the leading dedicated small satellite launch provider. I’m looking forward to building on the already impressive capabilities of Rocket Lab for government missions and working with government agencies to better support the expansion of commercial space.”
