Auckland, New Zealand. 18 September 2018.

Applications for Rocket Lab’s 2018 tertiary scholarship are now open, offering New Zealand’s future innovators, scientists and engineers an opportunity to get a head-start in STEM careers.

Now in its second year, the annual Rocket Lab scholarship encourages students from the Māhia Peninsula and wider Wairoa District in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand, to pursue tertiary study in science, technology and engineering disciplines.

Through the scholarship, one outstanding undergraduate student each year will receive up to $5,000 per year for tertiary fees, for up to four years of study – a total of up to $20,000. The recipient will also receive hands-on mentorship from Rocket Lab.

Rocket Lab scholars must have a strong connection to the Māhia and wider Wairoa District, demonstrate an interest in science, technology or engineering and be involved in cultural, community or leadership activities.

Rocket Lab Founder and Chief Executive Mr. Peter Beck says, “Growing New Zealand's STEM talent pool is something I'm very passionate about. New Zealand is a global leader in space, innovation and technology, and Rocket Lab is proud to support students from Māhia and Wairoa to play an increasing role in that international success."

The inaugural scholarship was awarded to Māhia local, Arianna Ormond in 2017. Miss Ormond, who is studying a Bachelor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Waikato University, says the scholarship has given her the freedom to focus entirely on her studies.

 “The Rocket Lab scholarship has been a huge help. These days the first year of university is free, but there are still many other expenses involved with leaving home to attend university in another city. I was able to put the first year’s scholarship fees towards accommodation costs, allowing me to focus on study. I’m looking forward to working closely with the Rocket Lab team for mentoring, as I progress my studies and work towards a career in artificial intelligence.”

Miss Ormond’s university grades have helped her to land an internship with [Code Avengers](https://www.codeavengers.com/), an educational tech company that teaches people the skills to build websites and apps.  

Applications for the Rocket Lab scholarship close on 30 October 2018 for the 2019 tertiary study year.
