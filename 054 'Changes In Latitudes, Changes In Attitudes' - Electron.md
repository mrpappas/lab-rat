>[!Success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
[[./Electron|Electron]]'s 54th mission, **'Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes'**, was a dedicated mission to low Earth orbit for a confidential commercial customer that launched from Rocket Lab [[./Launch Complex 1|Launch Complex 1]] on November 5th, 2024. The mission was Rocket Lab's 12th launch of 2024, increasing the record number of [[./Electron|Electron]] launches achieved annually since orbital launch services began in 2018. 
>
Rocket Lab’s rapid call-up launch capability, its standardized and rapid production of [[./Electron|Electron]] launch vehicles that ensures a rocket can be assigned a payload for on-demand launch within days, responsive launch sites, and its experienced team behind the second most frequently launched U.S. orbital rocket, were key enablers for this mission.
