## Vertical Integration Strategy

In a May '24 interview Peter Beck detailed Rocket Lab's methodology behind making acquisitions, giving three primary reasons: 

>[!quote]
>1.  "If the supply chain can not provide us the surety to deliver what we need, then we’ll go and vertically integrate"
>2. “If it’s too expensive and it’s too slow, generally we need to own it because we can make it cheaper and faster”
>3. "Is this going to be strategically important to us in the future for stuff that we think we're going to do"
