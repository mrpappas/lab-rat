## Notes

- Vector Acquisition Corporation announced a restatement of financial statements for the periods from July 28, 2020 (inception) to December 31, 2020, and interim periods in 2020 due to the reclassification of warrants as liabilities.  
- This adjustment was prompted by the SEC's public statement on accounting considerations for SPAC warrants.  
- The affected financial statements should no longer be relied upon, and the company filed an amended Form 10-K reflecting the reclassification.
