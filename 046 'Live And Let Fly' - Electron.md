>[!summary]
The NROL-123 mission, called ‚ÄòLive And Let Fly‚Äô,was Rocket Lab‚Äôs first launch for the [[./National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)|National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)]] from the United States after previously launching four NRO missions from Launch Complex 1 on New Zealand‚Äôs Mahia Peninsula. It was Rocket Lab‚Äôs 4th mission from [[./Launch Complex 2|Launch Complex 2]], a dedicated pad for the Electron rocket located at Virginia Spaceport Authority's Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport within the NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.  
>
The ‚ÄòLive And Let Fly‚Äô launch service was acquired using NRO‚Äôs Rapid Acquisition of a Small Rocket (RASR) contract. RASR enables the NRO to explore new opportunities for launching small satellites through a streamlined, commercial approach. NRO missions provide critical information to more than a half-million government users, including every member of the Intelligence Community, two dozen domestic agencies, the military, lawmakers, and decision makers.
