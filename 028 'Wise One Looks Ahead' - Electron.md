>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
Wise One Looks Ahead was the first of two back-to-back launches for the National Reconnaissance Office. 
>
The Wise One Looks Ahead mission (NROL-162) lifted-off from Launch Complex 1‚Äôs Pad A at 06:30 UTC on July 13, 2022. The mission will be followed up with Antipodean Adventure (NROL-199) as early as July 22, 2022.
>
The NROL-162 and NROL-199 missions carry national security payloads designed, built, and operated by the National Reconnaissance Office in partnership with the Australian Department of Defence as part of a broad range of cooperative satellite activities with Australia. The satellites will support the NRO to provide critical information to government agencies and decision makers monitoring international issues.
>
These twin missions are a demonstration of responsive launch under NRO‚Äôs Rapid Acquisition of a Small Rocket (RASR) contract for launching small satellite through a streamlined, commercial approach, and are the third and fourth missions contracted to Rocket Lab by the NRO under the contract. NROL-151 (RASR-1) was successfully deployed to space on a dedicated Electron launch in early 2020, followed by RASR-2 on another Electron launch in June 2020.
