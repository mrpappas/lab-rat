Rocket Lab is honored to have received two awards in the 2014 NZ Innovators Awards. The Electron launch vehicle took home the top prize for Innovation in Design and Engineering, while Rocket Lab, CEO and technical director Peter Beck was named Most Inspiring Individual.

The awards follow the recent announcement of Rocket Labâ€™s orbital launch vehicle program, which will provide a low-cost and frequent launch service to Low Earth Orbit. The project has already contributed significant innovation in the areas of carbon-composite and propulsion technology, in addition to its future role in reducing the commercial barriers for the emerging small satellite market.
