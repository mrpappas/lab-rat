Vast is a privately-held American aerospace company headquartered in Long Beach, California. It was founded in 2021 by entrepreneur [Jed McCaleb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jed-mccaleb-4052a4/) with the goal of developing artificial gravity space stations to "expand humanity beyond the solar system". Vast plans on launching their [[#Haven-1]] single-module station in 2026 and using the heritage and learnings from that to build out their multi-module [[#Haven-2]] starting in 2028.
>
>Vast does not have a funded contract for the Phase 1 portion of the [CLD program](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-space/low-earth-orbit-economy/commercial-destinations-in-low-earth-orbit/), where NASA is supporting Axiom Space, Blue Origin and Starlab Space on their space station concepts, but does have an unfunded Space Act Agreement with the agency for technical support. NASA expects to release a draft solicitation for Phase 2 of CLD in the summer 2025 and final version in the fall 2025. Phase 2 will fund certification of commercial space stations for use by NASA and purchases of services from them.

## Haven Demo
üîó https://www.vastspace.com/roadmap

Haven Demo is an in-orbit test bed for critical space station technologies. Haven Demo will test in orbit critical systems such as compute, power, software, guidance and control, propulsion, radios, ground stations, mission control, and more, for Haven-1. Launch is planned for "later in the summer" 2025 on a Falcon 9 rideshare. 
### Specs

**Mass**: 515 kg
**Mission Life**: 6 Months
**Orbit**: 500-600 km | 45.1¬∞
**Launch Vehicle**: Falcon 9

## Haven-1
üîó https://www.vastspace.com/haven-1
üìΩÔ∏è [[#Haven-1 Promo]]

Targeted to launch in **May 2026**, Haven-1 is a single-module space station planned for [[üåç Orbits#LEO|LEO]]. Haven-1 is planned to act as an independent crewed space station serving four two-week long missions, with planned ~9 month uncrewed periods in between each mission. The station will be launched with on-board consumables to last 160 crew days. 

The station plans to have logistics on board to facilitate docking with the [SpaceX Dragon](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/dragon/) spacecraft, with it being able to extend the on-orbit duration of spaceflight missions to up to 30 days. With the addition of the Dragon spacecraft, Haven-1 would be able to sustain 4-crew missions with 24/7 communication facilities, up to 1,000 watts of power, up to 150 kg of preloaded cargo mass, and science, research, and in-space manufacturing opportunities for up to 30 days.

Haven-1 is set to house a microgravity research facility, called the Haven-1 Lab, serving as the station's microgravity research, development and manufacturing platform. It will have 10 slots, each capable of accommodating payloads weighing up to 30 kilograms and consuming up to 100 watts of power. The first companies to agree to place payloads on Haven-1 have been announced as [Redwire](https://redwirespace.com/) and [Yuri Gravity](https://yurigravity.com/).

R&D costs for Haven-1 are projected at $1 Billion.

## Haven-2
üîó https://www.vastspace.com/haven-2
üìΩÔ∏è [[#Haven-2 Promo]]

Targeted to start launching in 2028, Haven-2 is a planned multi-module space station to be deployed to [[üåç Orbits#LEO|LEO]]. Vast is designing Haven-2 as a commercial successor to the ISS. 

Haven-2 will begin as a single module based on [[#Haven-1]] (stretched from 10.1 m to 16 m and including two docking ports) launched on a Falcon Heavy in 2028. Vast plans to launch three more modules from 2029 to 2030, docked in a line, each with upgraded life support systems. A seven-meter Starship-launched core module will then be added, centered between the four original modules. The core module will have a fifth docking port and an airlock for EVAs. By 2032, Vast plans to add four more modules, including one with a 3.8 m cupola and one with external payload racks for scientific experiments. Each of the eight modules will have two Earth-facing 1.1 m windows.

## Artificial Gravity Station
üîó https://www.vastspace.com/roadmap

Still in the planning stages, Vast aims to deploy a modular 'stick' configuration artificial gravity station by 2035. "This future station will represent the ultimate step in our vision of enabling humanity to live in space long-term, building on the modularity of its Haven-2 predecessor and generating artificial gravity by rotating end over end at 3.5 RPM."
