Starlab is a planned [[üåç Orbits#LEO|LEO]] commercial space station, projected to launch in 2029, the station will launch fully assembled on a single SpaceX Starship. Starlab is a joint venture between Voyager, [Airbus](https://www.airbus.com/en/products-services/space), [Mitsubishi](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/bu/space/), and [MDA](https://mda.space/). Additional partners include Northrop Grumman, Palantir, Hilton, and Ohio State University. Voyager revealed in its [prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1788060/000162828025026244/voyager-sx1.htm) that it projects Starlab to cost **$2.8 billion to $3.3 billion** to develop. The core of the station is [Airbus's LOOP multi-purpose orbital module](https://www.airbus.com/sites/g/files/jlcbta136/files/2023-05/202304_AirbusLOOP_Brochure_V0.pdf). It will also include a smaller equipment bay module (storage, support systems, hygiene facilities) and is supported by a powerful service module with a 60kW power and propulsion element (PPE).

## Awards

- In Dec 2021 Nanoracks (majority owned by Voyager) was awarded a <span style="color:limegreen">$160 million</span> Space Act Agreement to "support the design and development of commercial space stations" as part of NASA's Commercial LEO Destinations Program. [Source](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-companies-to-develop-commercial-destinations-in-space/)
- In Jan 2024 Voyager received an additional <span style="color:limegreen">$57.5 million</span> to its original $160 million award. The new funding to be used for various development milestones focused on operations, assembly, integration and testing, as well as a rendezvous and proximity operations demonstration. Some of those funds are allocated for upgrades to [Northrop Grumman's Cygnus cargo spacecraft](https://www.northropgrumman.com/space/cygnus-spacecraft) to add capability to dock directly with Starlab.
