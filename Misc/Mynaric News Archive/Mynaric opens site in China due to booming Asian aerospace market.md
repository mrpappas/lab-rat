- Mynaric announces new site in Shanghai, China, to further company’s reach into key markets
- Measures come as a consequence of high demand for Mynaric’s products and booming aerospace market in Asia

**Munich, November 19, 2018 –** Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, Scale 50, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11) can announce today that it is opening a new site in Shanghai, China, as a consequence of the high demand for its products and the rapidly-expanding Asian aerospace communications market.

The numerous developments in the aerospace communications industry in Asia have driven Mynaric to physically place itself at the heart of one of the fastest growing aerospace markets in the world. The new site is designed to improve access to this burgeoning market in order for Mynaric to sell products in Asia.

China is already one of the fastest growing space nations and is experiencing a boom in its aircraft industry, with several Asian companies and organizations announcing plans to pursue satellite networks in low Earth orbit (LEO) and with experts predicting the country will become the world’s second largest aerospace market in the coming years. Sustained growth in several Asian countries has triggered demand for connectivity solutions for those parts of the population that currently have no access to the internet.

> One of the key pillars of our business strategy is internationalization, and today’s announcement concerning our move into Asian markets mirrors our actions in North America where we established a subsidiary in 2016. Operating regional offices in North America and Asia, in unison with our headquarters in Europe, allows us to capture the world’s most important aerospace markets and fully establish ourselves as a true global player.

> ##### Dr Wolfram Peschko, CEO of Mynaric

**About Mynaric  
**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to establish dynamic communication networks in air and space. Its wireless laser data transmission products include ground stations and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances between aircraft, autonomous drones, high altitude platforms, satellites and the ground at high data rates.

Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its wireless laser communication products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
