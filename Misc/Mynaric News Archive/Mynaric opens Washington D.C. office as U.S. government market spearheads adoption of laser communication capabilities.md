**Gilching, February 02, 2021 –** Mynaric can announce today that it is expanding its U.S footprint by opening an office in Washington D.C. to place its team closer to U.S. government organizations driving the adoption of laser communication.

The U.S. government is the driving force for the rapid deployment of laser communication capabilities, currently, and as such also a catalyst for the adoption by commercial stakeholders. The Space Development Agency alone is expected to procure up to 150 satellites equipped with laser communication capabilities in 2021 as part of its Tranche 1 Transport layer and Mynaric is seeing increased interest from the sector following its selection for two U.S. governmental programs last year.

> The industrial age of laser communication is now upon us and the company that can carry the benefits of laser communication to both the commercial and government sector – and support that message with cost-efficient and readily available high specification products – will be the company that will shape the future of airborne and spaceborne communication networks. I believe Mynaric is that company, and today’s announcement demonstrates our commitment to dominate this market for years to come.”
> 
> **– Bulent Altan, CEO, Mynaric**

Mynaric has also appointed five highly-experienced professionals from the pinnacle of the aerospace industry to its global sales, business development and program management team to cement, and expand, the company’s position as one of the leading laser communication manufacturers capable of equipping both the commercial and government sectors.

Mynaric’s Washington office will be led by Jackson Kemper III, formerly of Tresys, Inmarsat, and Iridium, and Ali Younis, formerly of SES, Intelsat, and Astranis, who will head – respectively – US government sales and US commercial sales.

Mynaric’s sales and business development team focusing on the rest of the world will be led by Hanna Steplewska, who serves as our VP of Sales and Business Development, based in Munich. Hanna brings over two decades of global experience in similar functions at Virgin Orbit, Stratolaunch and Ruag.

Aerospace industry veteran Mike Reiss, who has previously been with Boeing, Thales, Panasonic, Rockwell Collins and Hughes Aircraft will serve from our Hawthorne, California office as VP of Program Management and Operations.

Ralph Emerson serves as VP of Account Management and is also based in California. Ralph brings 11 years of experience from PlaneWave where he oversaw the company’s entry into the laser communication market.

The aerospace connectivity market for laser communication is now crystalizing into distinct strands, with particular requirements: be it government or commercial sector; be it spaceborne or airborne; be it communication or surveillance. Today’s announcement reflects Mynaric’s commitment to these market segments, with individuals who bring a demonstrable focus on customer success and delivery in their own sphere of experience and ability.

> “To win just one of these incredibly talented individuals would be a coup; to win all five places Mynaric with one of – if not ‘the’ – strongest sales and customer service teams in the aerospace connectivity market.”
> 
> **– Tina Ghataore, President, Mynaric USA**

**About Mynaric**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to enable communication and surveillance applications in air and space. Its laser data transmission products include ground and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly and securely over long distances between aircraft, autonomous drones, high-altitude platforms, satellites and the ground.

Globally, the need for fast and secure connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or practical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its laser data transmission products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
