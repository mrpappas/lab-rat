**Munich, 13 October 2017** – Mynaric AG, the specialist for innovative, laser-based communications networks in the air and in space, has announced further details of its planned initial public offering on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Scale segment). The price range has been set at €45 to €54 per share. The final offer price will be determined by means of a bookbuilding process. The offer comprises up to 440,000 shares from a capital increase, as well as an over-allotment option (“greenshoe”) of up to 66,000 shares, also from a capital increase. Assuming that all the offered shares are sold, the issue volume is expected to be between €22.8 million and €27.3 million. Existing shareholders will not sell any shares in the initial public offering.

The offer period during which orders can be placed begins on 16 October 2017 and is expected to end on 25 October 2017 (at 12 noon for private investors and at 2 pm for institutional investors). The shares are planned to be listed in the Scale segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange as of 30 October 2017. All the details of the offering can be found in the securities prospectus approved today by the German financial supervisory authority BaFin and available for download from the Investor Relations section of the Mynaric website (www.mynaric.com).

**Mynaric offers a key technology for the internet of the future**

Mynaric was founded in 2009 by former employees of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). The company develops cutting-edge laser technologies for building global communications networks in the air and in space. Its products for wireless data transmission include ground stations and laser terminals that make it possible to transmit very large volumes of data at rates of several gigabits per second over thousands of kilometres.

> “Existing network infrastructure is reaching its limits. We need new solutions that meet the demand for increasing data volumes and security requirements. We see laser communications as a key technology for tomorrow’s data transmission. With our laser technology we have an excellent position in this growth market”  
> Dr Wolfram Peschko, Chief Executive Officer of Mynaric AG

The market for laser communications has significant growth potential. Most international telecommunication and data transmission currently takes place via optical, ground-based networks, such as fibre cables. In 2016, this market reported revenue of some US$ 17 billion, with forecast annual growth of 10.5 per cent.

**IPO to finance company growth**

Mynaric’s strategy for the years ahead is to become a leading international company for the implementation of dynamic communications networks in the air and in space.

> “The planned IPO opens up new opportunities for us to finance our company growth. We are seeing great interest in our products, so our objective is to move on to mass production as soon as possible,”  
> Dr Wolfram Peschko, Chief Executive Officer of Mynaric AG

Building a mass production operation requires investment in measuring technology and assembly facilities, for instance. The issue proceeds are therefore primarily intended for the development of an assembly and serial production facility. In addition, funds will be invested in the continued development of laser terminals for use in space, to increase the performance of the Mynaric products and to expand the company’s international footprint.

The offering consists of an initial public offering in the Federal Republic of Germany (the “public offer”) and a private placement for qualified investors in member states of the European Economic Area.

Shares in Mynaric AG have the international securities identification number (ISIN) DE000A0JCY11 and the German securities code (WKN) A0JCY1.

Hauck & Aufhäuser is acting as sole global coordinator and bookrunner for the IPO.
