**Washington D.C., May 12, 2021** – Mynaric and SpaceLink today agreed on the framework of a partnership to expand Mynaric’s laser communication product portfolio for use in SpaceLink’s data relay network. The strategic relationship will help drive forward the SpaceLink satellite relay service, which provides secure, continuous, high-capacity communications between low Earth orbit (LEO) spacecraft and the ground.

The companies will work together to expand Mynaric’s product portfolio with an optical inter-satellite link (OISL) terminal for satellites in medium Earth orbit (MEO), where the SpaceLink constellation will operate. The new terminal will also be compatible with the Space Development Agency (SDA) Transport Layer.

Mynaric will supply more than 40 OISL terminals as part of the plan outlined in a term sheet, which includes units of the new, advanced product for satellites in MEO as well as units of Mynaric’s CONDOR terminals for SpaceLink LEO customers. SpaceLink and Mynaric have also agreed to an option that would increase the number of terminals delivered upon SpaceLink’s expansion of its MEO constellation.

Laser communication technology is critical for SpaceLink to build the communication superhighways for the new space economy. Mynaric’s product portfolio is a natural choice as it meets SpaceLink’s programmatic requirements, provides high performance, and is fully compliant with the OISL Standard driven by the SDA. This is a major benefit that allows SpaceLink to serve the largest possible range of commercial and government customers.

SpaceLink is building its high-capacity data relay network to meet pent-up demand for continuous, fast, and secure access to the growing amount of data available from space. The Always in Sight™ constellation helps satellite operators maximize the value of on-orbit assets with near real time transmission of user data to the ground for immediate access via the Internet, private cloud, or other secure delivery. Mynaric was selected as a supplier to support SpaceLink’s mission given its industrialized approach towards the production of advanced laser communication products.

> “Our work with Mynaric to implement advanced OISL capability into the SpaceLink constellation will ensure performance and interoperability. Mynaric has exceptional expertise to advance a new generation of OISLs that address our requirements and our mission to speed massive amounts of data to users no matter where they are located on Earth. Together with Mynaric, SpaceLink will enable our customers to take a quantum leap in delivering data that saves lives and advances humanity to a new age of space commerce, exploration, environmental awareness, and security.”  
> **David Bettinger, CEO SpaceLink**
> 
> “This partnership closes on the largest direct acquisition of laser communication products by a commercial entity to date to our knowledge and touches multiple aspects that are at the core of our strategy of industrializing laser communications: Signing a lead customer to expand our product portfolio with a product suitable for MEO satellites while gaining a channel partner for our LEO terminals compliant with the SDA Standard. We are excited to partner with SpaceLink to supply products to and support their mission to enable secure, high-capacity data access in space.”  
> **Bulent Altan, CEO Mynaric**

**About Spacelink**  
SpaceLink is building an information superhighway for the space economy that will help advance humanity to a new age of space commerce, exploration, environmental awareness, and security. The Always in Sight™ data relay system provides global coverage to empower space system operators to maximize use of their assets. SpaceLink Corporation is headquartered in the Washington DC area and has offices in Silicon Valley, California. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Electro Optic Systems Holdings Limited, a public company traded on the Australian stock exchange.

**About Mynaric**  
Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11) produces the optical fiber for the skies and, as a pioneer of laser communication, enables extremely fast and secure wireless data transmission between aircraft, drones and satellites. Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks such as the internet are now largely based on infrastructure on the ground which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future, therefore, calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. Mynaric provides laser communication products to establish the necessary data highways for telecommunication constellations in air and space.
