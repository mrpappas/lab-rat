**HAWTHORNE, Calif., November 9, 2021 –** Mynaric has been unveiled as Capella Space’s supplier for optical inter-satellite links (OISL). [Capella Space announced today that they will become the first commercial Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) company to demonstrate compatibility with the U.S. Space Development Agency’s (SDA) National Defense Space Architecture](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/capella-space-to-become-first-commercial-sar-company-to-demonstrate-compatibility-with-the-us-space-development-agencys-national-defense-space-architecture-ndsa-301419796.html), a large-scale satellite constellation providing a range of capabilities to U.S. warfighters and to be comprised of several hundred laser-linked satellites. Mynaric will be delivering its next generation optical communications terminal, CONDOR Mk3, to Capella Space to ensure this compatibility. In August, Mynaric already announced the signing of Capella Space as a then undisclosed launch customer as part of the [product’s debut at the 36th annual Space Symposium](https://mynaric.com/news/mynaric-releases-next-generation-ultra-fast-scalable-optical-communications-terminal-for-satellite-applications/). Earlier, industry media reported that the [SDA is looking to work with commercial operators of imaging satellites](https://spacenews.com/dod-space-agency-to-create-marketplace-for-commercial-satellite-data/) so they can send data directly to U.S. government satellites in orbit.

> “After a thorough vetting process, it was clear that Mynaric’s CONDOR Mk3 is the premier solution to interweave our services with the U.S. Space Development Agency’s National Defense Space Architecture,” said **Christian Lenz**, Chief Technology Officer of Capella Space. “We have selected the CONDOR Mk3 optical communications terminal for our critical, highly reliable and secure data transmission needs due to its demonstrated compatibility, performance and availability.”
> 
> “We have a [proven track record of demonstrated compatibility with SDA’s interoperability standard for optical inter-satellite links](https://mynaric.com/news/mynaric-becomes-first-company-to-successfully-demonstrate-oisl-standard-of-u-s-space-development-agency/),” said **Tina Ghataore**, Chief Commercial Officer of Mynaric. “This is just the beginning of a strong partnership between Capella Space and Mynaric and illustrates the importance of our efforts on interoperability and serial production capabilities to meet the needs of our commercial and governmental customers.”

The CONDOR Mk3 ensures compatibility with the U.S. Space Development Agency’s (SDA) optical communications terminal standard. Detailed technical specifications of the product can be requested from the [CONDOR Mk3 product page](https://mynaric.com/products/condor-mk3/).

**About Mynaric**

Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11) produces the optical fiber for the skies and, as a pioneer of laser communication, enables extremely fast and secure wireless data transmission between aircraft, drones and satellites. Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks such as the internet are now largely based on infrastructure on the ground which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future, therefore, calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. Mynaric provides laser communication products to establish the necessary data highways for telecommunication constellations in air and space.
