- Study comes on the heels of Mynaric’s product unveiling and production ramp-up
- Industry analysts expect 2020 to be the inflection point for commercial satellite constellations
- Newly-initiated study is available to professional investors and provides in-depth analysis of Mynaric’s investment case

**Munich, January 8, 2020 –** Shares in Mynaric (ISIN: DE000A0JCY11 / WKN: A0JCY1) have today received a ‘buy’ rating and a EUR 75 price target from one of the longest-established private banks in Europe, Hauck & Aufhäuser.

The newly-initiated coverage, with an initial report title of “Reaching for the stars” and authored by stock analyst Tim Wunderlich, offers comprehensive analysis of Mynaric as an investment case.

Today’s report follows Mynaric’s recent product unveiling and news that it has more than 30 laser communication units in production cycle planned for 2020: a figure that sets Mynaric apart from any other laser communication company in the world. First HAWK *AIR* terminals for airborne applications are currently being completed this month and first CONDOR terminals designed for satellite constellations will become available from the second half of 2020.

The publication also comes at the start of a year that will see an inflection point for satellite constellations, most of which plan to deploy laser communication systems as soon as they become available. Proof of this commercial turning point is demonstrated by companies such as SpaceX – just one of numerous companies building a spaceborne constellation – which has already launched three batches of satellites for its constellation and whose COO is on record committing the company to at least two launches a month throughout 2020. The company’s most recent launch this week makes it the world’s largest satellite constellation operator with just under 180 satellites already in orbit.

The new initiation study is available to professional investors directly from Hauck & Aufhäuser. Mynaric is additionally covered by stock analysts of MainFirst bank (EUR 80, Outperform) and Edison investment research.

**About Mynaric  
**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to establish dynamic communication networks in air and space. Its wireless laser data transmission products include ground stations and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances between aircraft, autonomous drones, high altitude platforms, satellites and the ground at high data rates.

Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its wireless laser communication products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
