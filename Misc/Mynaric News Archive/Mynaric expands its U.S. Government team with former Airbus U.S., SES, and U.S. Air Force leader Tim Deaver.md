**May 14, 2021, Washington, D.C. –** Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11) has announced that Tim Deaver with over 30 years of experience with governmental space programs has been appointed VP Strategic Solutions.

Tim will operate out of Mynaric’s newly established Washington, D.C. area office and will be responsible for creating and marketing customer solutions, particularly in response to the critical needs of the U.S. Department of Defense and other government clients. Prime among these will be the build out of the Space Development Agency’s (SDA) Transport Layer Tranche 1 constellation of up to 150 satellites, each of which will feature between three to five optical terminals. The satellites are scheduled to be procured through an RFP to be issued by SDA in Q3 2021.

> “I am absolutely delighted to welcome Tim to our team. He is an authority in the industry and has a proven track-record of successfully winning business from and providing valuable solutions for various parts of the U.S. Government. Laser communication is at an inflection point right now and the U.S. Government is playing a catalyzing role in transitioning the technology to industrial-scale deployment. Tim is joining just at the right time to allow us to leverage on that dynamic.”  
> **Tina Ghataore, CCO, Mynaric**

Tim joins Mynaric from Airbus U.S. Space & Defense where he was Director of National Security Space Systems responsible for managing the company’s U.S. Government space-related marketing, program capture, program management and customer liaison activities since 2018.

Prior to joining Airbus U.S., Tim worked for SES and SES Government Solutions for over 10 years where he led business and product development activities. At SES Government Services the team under his leadership won several high-profile opportunities including U.S. Air Force Space and Missile System Center Pathfinder 1 and 3 contracts, and commercially hosted research and navigation payloads for NASA and the FAA. Tim also served as the program manager and eventually the Program Executive for the U.S. Air Force’s Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload (CHIRP). Prior to joining SES, Tim served 22 years in the U.S. Air Force in various space operational, intelligence, acquisition, and policy positions.

**About Mynaric**

Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11) produces the optical fiber for the skies and, as a pioneer of laser communication, enables extremely fast and secure wireless data transmission between aircraft, drones and satellites.

Globally, the need for fast, secure and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks such as the internet are now largely based on infrastructure on the ground which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future, therefore, calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. Mynaric pioneers this growth market with an industrialized approach to wireless laser communication products.
