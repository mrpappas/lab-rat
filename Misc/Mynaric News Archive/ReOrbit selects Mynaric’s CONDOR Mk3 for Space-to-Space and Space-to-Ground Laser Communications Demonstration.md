**MUNICH, June 25, 2024 –** [Mynaric](https://mynaric.com/) (NASDAQ: MYNA) (FRA: M0YN), a leading provider of industrialized, cost-effective and scalable laser communications products, today announced that it has been selected by [ReOrbit](https://www.reorbit.space/) to supply its CONDOR Mk3 terminal for the upcoming mission UKKO, aimed at demonstrating secure space-to-space and space-to-ground communication for Earth Observation.

> “At ReOrbit, we firmly believe that the space industry is now entering the era of horizontal consolidation and vertical cooperation. As a leading player in the NewSpace economy, we work with an established supplier network for the hardware components, and this time, we are happy to source CONDOR Mk3 terminal from Mynaric for our upcoming UKKO mission. The future of space applications, where data sharing and communications take place not only from space to ground, but also from space to space – enabling satellites to network, communicate with each other and thus improve mission efficiency, starts today,” commented **Sethu Saveda Suvanam, CEO and Founder of ReOrbit**.
> 
> “We are honored that ReOrbit has chosen our advanced laser communications technology for their innovative software-first satellite,” said **Lubos Fedora, Senior Sales and Business Development Manager of Mynaric**. “Mynaric has already proven that our terminals can link with others for satellite interoperability and the success of this demonstration will highlight the ability of ReOrbit satellites to operate within this framework.”

This program strengthens Mynaric’s position as a leading optical communications technology supplier to European organizations and government entities. Mynaric was previously selected by the [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://mynaric.com/news/mynaric-selected-by-esa-to-investigate-optical-technologies-for-next-generation-high-throughput-optical-inter-satellite-links/) to investigate optical technologies for next generation high-throughput optical inter-satellite links and was selected by the German government for [multiple projects to develop quantum communication capabilities](https://mynaric.com/news/mynaric-selected-by-german-government-for-multiple-projects-to-develop-quantum-communication-capabilities/).

In the first quarter of 2024, Mynaric announced that [volume production had begun on the company’s flagship space terminal – the CONDOR Mk3](https://mynaric.com/news/volume-production-begins-for-mynarics-flagship-space-laser-terminal-condor-mk3/), which is specifically designed for mass deployment as part of government and commercial satellite constellations.
