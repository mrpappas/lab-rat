- Considerable progress in move from a development company to a production company
- Exclusive industry partnership gives company an edge in product development
- Market momentum increasing and competition steadily growing, but Mynaric excellently positioned

**Munich, October 29, 2018 –** Mynaric, a producer of laser communication terminals for the aerospace communications industry, has published its H1 2018 report and updates on considerable technological and product milestones during the first six months of the financial year 2018.

**Picking up speed in the move to serial production**

In the first half of 2018, Mynaric put in place systems and processes to help transfer the company into a serial producer of laser communication terminals. Following a recent milestone delivery of a ground station to a customer, Mynaric has now formally moved into serial production of its two types of optical ground stations for, respectively, air-to-ground and space-to-ground data transfer.

**Product development on track and benefits from technology collaborations**

Mynaric successfully strengthened its global partner network with expert technology partners, one such being CEA-Leti in France. In working exclusively with Leti, Mynaric has access to a component that promises market-changing improvements to their laser communication products’ specifications. Development of Mynaric’s laser terminal for space continues apace and critical development milestones have been passed in H1 2018.

**Report shows a burgeoning market attracting ever greater interest and investment**

The aerospace telecommunications market continues to grow at an astonishing rate and new players –started by both venturous newcomers and established industry veterans – are emerging to leverage on new opportunities. With laser communication being one of the crucial technologies enabling these new business models more competition is entering the market but today’s report shows how Mynaric is positioned better than ever to remain, nevertheless, a leading player in the lasercom market.

**Financial results continue to develop positively, and strong FY 2018 expected**

Mynaric’s operative subsidiary responsible for sales, manufacturing and development achieved a total output of EUR 2.7 million in the first half of 2018 – already 85% of the full year results for 2017. Financial performance in the second half of 2018 is expected to surpass that of the first half due to the onset of serial production of ground stations, as well as other factors.

**About Mynaric  
**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to establish dynamic communication networks in air and space. Its wireless laser data transmission products include ground stations and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances between aircraft, autonomous drones, high altitude platforms, satellites and the ground at high data rates.

Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its wireless laser communication products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
