**MUNICH, October 4, 2023** –  [Mynaric](https://mynaric.com/) (NASDAQ: MYNA) (FRA: M0YN), a leading provider of industrialized, cost-effective and scalable laser communications products, successfully hosted a regional event that delved into the exciting prospects and challenges of aerospace innovations, marking the ascendancy of STA:rs County as a burgeoning hub in Munich West’s aerospace landscape.

On the 21 <sup>st</sup> of September 2023, experts and representatives from industry, research, and the investment sector met for a panel discussion at the NEW SPACE company Mynaric. Under the motto “Dare more progress,” as established by the federal government in its coalition agreement two years ago, organizer Dr. Manfred Leipold, Mynaric Lasercom, called on the panel to scrutinize the opportunities and conditions for start-up companies in Bavaria: “The industrialization of space has begun,” he added.

Moderated by Mynaric’s Dr. Martin Haunschild, previously head of the bavAIRia aerospace cluster in Gilching, Landtag candidate (FDP) and Deputy District Administrator Britta Hundesrügge advocated for the location in the district. Optimal education is a crucial factor for this location, and networking with Munich’s universities could be further intensified here. The district offers very good conditions for start-ups, however improved public transport links and affordable housing remain open challenges. “STA:rs County” could set a new, striking trademark here, she added, in reference to the high-tech competence center of the “Star City” near Moscow in the early days of space travel.

Dr. Clemens Kaiser, Chief Program Officer of RIVADA Space Networks, Munich, then explained the opportunities and current projects of his company, which receives financing capital from the USA to implement networking within satellite constellations of hundreds of orbital platforms in the near future. The project aims to establish “wireless internet above the clouds,” with data rates of several gigabits per second.

Ms. Stephanie Herrman, Chief Financial Officer of the Anwendungszentrum Oberpfaffenhofen (AZO), mentioned with due pride that the AZO, with the ESA Business Incubation Center she has led since 2005, has already accompanied more than 240 start-up companies on their path to foundation. The Starnberg district is – seen nationwide – leading in the number of new foundations. Just a few weeks ago, a new company from Wörthsee was awarded the Founder’s Prize 2023 – a hint at the attractiveness of the Starnberg district location. The aerospace company Mynaric, which was supported by AZO in 2009 and, following IPOs in Frankfurt and on NASDAQ New York, is now an internationally extremely successful company, providing attractive jobs for now more than 270 employees.

Christoph Winkelkötter, CEO of the Society for Economic and Tourism Development in the Starnberg district, campaigned for targeted promotion of high-tech locations, which also attract skilled workers from abroad, instead of distributing this on the part of the state with a watering can across Bavaria. “No one wants to go to Tirschenreuth,” he said – the state politics must heed this. Our technological spearheads must be sharpened in order to continue to operate successfully in the international environment.

After the end of the panel discussion and a question-and-answer session, there was further room for networking for the approximately 40 participants at the event. New opportunities and perspectives for “STA:rs County” may have found their origin on that late afternoon.
