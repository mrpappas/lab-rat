**Stepwise start of serial production key to market leadership**

With serial production for ground stations commenced in 2018 and a planned start of production of the airborne product mid-2019, Mynaric is on track to become the first and only company globally to offer a complete portfolio of mature and deployable products needed to realize laser communication in airborne applications. The development of Mynaric’s terminal for mega-constellations in low Earth orbit is expected to finish its qualification process in early-2020 with first deliveries of flight units soon after. These timelines put Mynaric in pole position among equipment suppliers who are racing to secure market shares in the booming, emerging market of aerospace networks.

**New management a commitment to customer-centric approach**

Today’s report expands on the role that Mynaric’s new executive board will play in taking the company into the next phase of its commercial development and examines the strong customer-centric approach the management is pushing to advance the company to further heights. Key to this approach is Bulent Altan’s extensive experience at SpaceX, where he developed invaluable insights from a customer’s perspective on how laser communication products need to look like in the space market, as well as Hubertus von Janecek’s 20-year track record in global sales of deep tech products. Both recently joined Wolfram Peschko who has led Mynaric’s development since 2011.

**New building a physical demonstration of Mynaric’s progress and focus on commercial market**

Annual Report 2018 gives details of Mynaric’s new 4,500 sq. meter premises in the heart of the Bavarian aerospace community on the outskirts of Munich.

State-of-the-art facilities, including laboratories, advanced equipment, and production halls have all been designed to help smooth and facilitate the manufacturing process as well as help Mynaric introduce advanced testing capabilities to ensure its airborne and spaceborne terminals are ready for the harsh environments they will face in the upper atmosphere and in low Earth orbit.

**Market moves from the drawing board to implementation**

The report features an extensive review and forecast of the aerospace communication networks market that the global tech elite is advancing and details why 2019 is expected to be the year projects move from the drawing board to implementation, enabling an industry that will be essential to global economic growth in the coming decades by delivering high-speed and secure connectivity for consumers, corporates and governmental organizations alike.

**About Mynaric  
**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to establish dynamic communication networks in air and space. Its wireless laser data transmission products include ground stations and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances between aircraft, autonomous drones, high altitude platforms, satellites and the ground at high data rates.

Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its wireless laser communication products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
