Mynaric has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with California-based Airborne Wireless Network (OTCQB: ABWN), an important step towards integrating Mynarics’s series of airborne laser communication terminals into the Inifinitus Super Highway™, a proposed fully-meshed airborne broadband system that will forever change in-flight connectivity.

> “Mynaric’s approach to commercializing wireless laser communications is exactly what we were looking for. We see a strong partnership unfolding between our two companies and look forward to taking the next steps together.”  
> Mike Warren, CEO of ABWN

> “The Airborne Wireless Network concept fits squarely into Mynaric’s business model of mass producing these sophisticated communications systems. We are excited to be working with the team at ABWN to really bring wireless laser communications into the mainstream market.”  
> Markus Knapek, CEO of Mynaric Lasercom GmbH

Laser is 100% secure from jamming, as well as interception. It remains stealth due to its narrow beam divergence. The proposed network system would utilize a combination of radio frequencies and lasers to transmit data for ultra-long-distance communications. This proposed high-bandwidth system would put it far beyond the reach of any current competing technologies.

**Airborne Wireless Network**  
The Company intends to create a high-speed broadband airborne wireless network by linking commercial aircraft in flight. It is projected that each aircraft participating in the network will act as an airborne repeater or router, sending and receiving broadband signals from one aircraft to the next and creating a digital superhighway in the sky. The Company intends the network to be a high-speed broadband internet pipeline to improve coverage connectivity. The Company does not intend to provide retail customer coverage to end users, but, instead, act as a wholesale carrier with target customers, such as internet service providers and telephone companies.  
Currently, the world’s connectivity is achieved by use of undersea cables, ground based fiber and satellites. The Company believes that the Company’s airborne digital highway may be a solution to fill the world’s connectivity void. Once the network is developed and fully implemented, its uses may be limitless. The Company’s network, once developed, should provide low cost, high-speed connectivity to rural areas, island nations, ships at sea, oil platforms, in addition to connectivity to commercial and private aircraft in flight.
