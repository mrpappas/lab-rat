**Inside information under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 596/2014 (Public disclosure)**

NOT FOR RELEASE OR DISTRIBUTION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, CANADA OR JAPAN OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH RELEASE OR DISTRIBUTION WOULD BE UNLAWFUL. OTHER RESTRICTIONS ARE APPLICABLE.

**Gilching, October 28, 2020 –** Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11), a leader in the design, development and manufacture of laser communication products for high-speed connectivity in air and space, has successfully raised gross proceeds of EUR 52.8 million via a capital increase from authorized capital. The amount was already fully placed during a pre-placement with institutional investors while full allocation was still conditional on the completion of a subscription rights offering to existing shareholders which ended on Monday.

Today’s announcement of the EUR 52.8 million capital increase gross proceeds brings Mynaric’s total funding to date to more than EUR 110 million which was and is being invested to industrialize laser communication products for commercial and governmental connectivity networks.

> “We are now starting to deliver first products into the hands of customers and are winning contracts for initial deployments of industrialized laser communication technology. Developments being driven by the commercial sector and, more recently and forcefully, by the government sector are heralding the industrial age of laser communication. The company that can meet the demand from these initial players, with products specifically designed for mass deployment, is the company that is best placed to lead this hugely dynamic and ever-growing market. With today’s announced funding and the recently won contracts we have all reasons to believe we are that company.”
> 
> **Bulent Altan, CEO, Mynaric**

Mynaric has recently announced contract wins to supply its laser communication products to two US government programs. The net proceeds of the capital increase will be used to build on these wins and support and consolidate Mynaric’s leading position in the market, specifically:

- To prepare for large-volume operational product deployment in order to secure its market position permanently. This entails moving towards production capabilities to be able to assemble triple digit units per year and implementing flexibility to scale output as needed by the market. Further, this includes work towards the development of second generation product iterations to include optimizations in the context of industrialization of laser communications.
- To win market share by leveraging existing products. Mynaric will expand its business development activities internationally to win additional lead customers, build-up support and maintenance capabilities to transition first customers to advocates, and shorten delivery times to enable new customers to validate the products at short notice.
- To expand Mynaric’s access to the key North American market. Increased US operations will enable on-premise and off-premise product demonstrations, mainly for the purpose of business development, and will create capabilities to provide customer support and handle sensitive data domestically.

**About Mynaric**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to enable communication and surveillance applications in air and space. Its laser data transmission products include ground and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly and securely over long distances between aircraft, autonomous drones, high-altitude platforms, satellites and the ground.

Globally, the need for fast and secure connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or practical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its laser data transmission products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
