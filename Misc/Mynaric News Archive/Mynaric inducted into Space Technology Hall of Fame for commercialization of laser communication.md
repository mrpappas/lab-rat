- Mynaric inducted into Space Technology Hall of Fame for adapting laser communication originally developed as a space technology to commercial applications
- Laser communication enables Internet provision for those without connectivity via aerospace communication networks
- Award to be bestowed on laser communications specialist at ceremony at the 34 <sup>th</sup> Space Symposium, Colorado Springs (USA), in April

**Munich, Colorado Springs, 16 February 2018** – Mynaric has today announced that it has been inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame for its work on transferring laser communication developed for research purposes to commercial applications. Its miniaturized laser terminals are being utilized to establish high-speed laser connectivity between aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites which are intended to build the data highways of an Internet above the clouds to connect the estimated 3 billion people still without connectivity.

The prestigious award, which has been awarded in tandem with the German Aerospace Center’s (DLR) Institute of Communications and Navigation division, was given in recognition of the company’s successful commercialization of laser communication. The technology was originally developed at DLR to transmit large amounts of data from research satellites and was transferred to Mynaric via a license agreement.

> “We are both honored and delighted to be inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame and are extremely grateful to the judges for this highly-respected accolade. It is acknowledgment not just of the effort of the highly-skilled team at Mynaric who design and produce our laser terminals but also recognition of the technology underpinning the products and the years of planning and hard work that went in to making it a reality.”  
> Dr Markus Knapek, founder and member of the Mynaric Management Board

Companies making use of Mynaric’s laser terminals include American aerospace customers who are in the process of deploying large networks of aircraft, all connected by laser, which can provide connectivity where conventional radio communication systems cannot. Mynaric’s laser communication products are a key technology in providing the backbone connectivity for these constellations and it is for this development that Mynaric’s work has been recognized by the Space Foundation.

> “DLR and Mynaric together have delivered a superb example of the amazing and often unexpected benefits of space exploration. The laser communication as commercialized by DLR and Mynaric represents the latest in a growing number of non-U.S. technologies to be honored with Space Technology Hall of Fame induction.”  
> Kevin C. Cook, Space Foundation Vice-President of Marketing & Communications

> “To be able to take our place next to organizations such as NASA, and companies such as Boeing and Airbus, as winners of this award shows how far we have come in a relatively short space of time. And even more encouraging, is to see our technological developments sitting alongside previous winning technologies that have proved their worth – as the award criteria states – in improving the quality of life for all humanity; technologies which have led to the worldwide-adoption of firefighter breathing systems, precision GPS software improving the safety of millions of air passengers and imaging software allowing for early detection of heart disease and stroke.”  
> Dr Wolfram Peschko, CEO of Mynaric, also thanked the judges for the award

Mynaric’s induction will take place at the 34 <sup>th</sup> Space Symposium award dinner in Colorado Springs (USA) in April.

**About Mynaric AG**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to establish dynamic communication networks in air and space. Its wireless laser data transmission products include ground stations and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances between aircrafts, autonomous drones, high altitude platforms, satellites and the ground at high data rates.

Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its wireless laser communication products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
