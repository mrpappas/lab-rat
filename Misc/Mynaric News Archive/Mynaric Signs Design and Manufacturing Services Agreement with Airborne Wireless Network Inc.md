Mynaric is pleased to announce that it has entered into a design and manufacturing services agreement with California-based Airborne Wireless Network (OTCQB: ABWN). Mynaric’s innovative airborne wireless laser communications technology will be integrated into ABWN’s proposed Infinitus Super Highway™, a broadband networking system using commercial aircraft as network nodes.

> “We are excited to be working with the team at Airborne Wireless Network to deliver the next innovation in in-flight connectivity. Mynaric is a front-runner in wireless laser communications for the aerospace market and this is exactly the type of application for which our products are designed.”  
> Dr. Markus Knapek, Managing Director of Mynaric Lasercom GmbH

> “We are extremely pleased to announce our collaboration with Mynaric, a world-renowned pioneer and developer of laser communication products. With this agreement, we can capitalize on Mynaric’s experience and expertise. ABWN’S new hybrid approach and the expertise provided by Mynaric should help mitigate challenges and have a significant impact on ABWN’s ability to launch its proposed global airborne wireless meshed network. ABWN and Mynaric envision a future where high data rate connectivity in the skies and beyond is as natural as on the ground and we believe this collaboration will enable this vision to move forward.”  
> Michael Warren, CEO of ABWN

**About Airborne Wireless Network**

The Company intends to create a high-speed broadband airborne wireless network by linking commercial aircraft in flight. It is projected that each aircraft participating in the network will act as an airborne repeater or router, sending and receiving broadband signals from one aircraft to the next and creating a digital superhighway in the sky. The Company intends the network to be a high-speed broadband internet pipeline to improve coverage connectivity. The Company does not intend to provide retail customer coverage to end users, but, instead, act as a wholesale carrier with target customers, such as internet service providers and telephone companies.

Currently, the world’s connectivity is achieved by use of undersea cables, ground based fiber and satellites. The Company believes that the Company’s airborne digital highway may be a solution to fill the world’s connectivity void. Once the network is developed and fully implemented, its uses may be limitless. The Company’s network, once developed, should provide low cost, high-speed connectivity to rural areas, island nations, ships at sea, oil platforms, in addition to connectivity to commercial and private aircraft in flight.
