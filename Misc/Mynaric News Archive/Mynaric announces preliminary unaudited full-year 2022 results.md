*Continued traction on key performance indicators as company prepares for serial production and shipments to key customers in 2H23*

**MUNICH, April 27, 2023 –** [Mynaric](https://mynaric.com/) (NASDAQ: MYNA) (FRA: M0YN), a leading provider of industrialized, cost-effective and scalable laser communications products, today announces preliminary unaudited results for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022.

“Mynaric finished 2022 with a solid terminal order backlog and is well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead of us as the adoption of laser communications accelerates in both the space and airborne domains,” said Bulent Altan and Mustafa Veziroglu, Co-CEOs of Mynaric. “2023 will be a defining year for Mynaric as we further focus on scaling up our production of optical communications terminals and new business growth opportunities.”

**Key 2022 and 2023 Highlights**

- Optical Communications Terminal Backlog at December 31, 2022 of 256 units (40 units as of December 31, 2021) and 348 as of April 27, 2023
- Cash in from Customer Contracts of EUR 18.3 million in 2022 (EUR 3.9 million as of 2021) exclusive of approximately EUR 11 million invoiced in December 2022 and received in January 2023. EUR 18.8 million received in 2023 to date as of April 27, 2023
- Multiple wins with Northrop Grumman for CONDOR Mk3 terminals, key contract with DARPA and a contract with commercial U.S.-based energy customer for HAWK terminals all signed in 2022

“With the recent closing of our new credit facility and equity investment, we have the capital needed to support our near-to-medium term delivery commitments and we are well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term opportunity for laser communications we see ahead of us,” said Stefan Berndt von-Bülow, CFO of Mynaric.

The forward-looking statements included in this release are based largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or are beyond our control, and actual results may differ materially from those expected or implied as forward-looking statements.
