## ‚úèÔ∏è Notes

 - On April 29 2024 **Unseen Labs** announced their next-gen satellite constellation, planned to be launched in 2026. This new constellation would expand "its surveillance capabilities to include terrestrial and space environments in addition to maritime". This announcement was made shortly after they secured and ‚Ç¨85 Million capital raise. 
   The new fleet would be compromised of 150-kg satellites, which is within [[./Electron|Electron]]'s payload limitations.
