The **Future Fund** is Australia's sovereign wealth fund, established in 2006 to strengthen the government's long-term financial position by investing for the benefit of future generations. As of November 2024, the fund manages approximately **A$230 billion** in assets. Its primary mandate is to achieve an average annual return of **4-5% above inflation** over the long term, with an acceptable but not excessive level of risk. In November 2024, the Australian government updated the fund's investment mandate to consider national priorities, including housing, energy transition, and infrastructure, while maintaining its focus on maximizing returns.
