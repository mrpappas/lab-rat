>[!failure] Mission Failure

>[!summary]
**It's a Test** was the first flight of Rocket Lab's Electron launch vehicle. The mission, launched from [[./Launch Complex 1|Launch Complex 1]] on New Zealand's Mahia Peninsula, marked a significant milestone as the first orbital-class rocket launched from a private launch site.  
>
Despite not reaching orbit, the mission successfully demonstrated key systems including a perfect first stage burn, stage separation, second stage ignition, and fairing separation, putting Rocket Lab in a strong position for future commercial operations.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Notes

 - "Rocket Lab‚Äôs investigation team determined the launch, named ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a Test‚Äô, was terminated due to a data loss time out, which was caused by misconfiguration of telemetry equipment owned and operated by a third-party contractor who was supporting the launch from Rocket Lab‚Äôs Launch Complex 1."
 - Being the first [[./Electron|Electron]] launch, there was no customer payload.
