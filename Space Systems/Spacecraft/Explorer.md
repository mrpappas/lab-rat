>[!summary]
A high delta-V spacecraft with large propellant tanks, deep space capable avionics, and ranging transponders. Explorer enables small spacecraft missions to planetary destinations like Mars and Venus, the Moon, highly eccentric Earth orbits, geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO), Earth-moon Lagrange points, Earth-sun Lagrange points, and near Earth objects (NEOs). Depending on the mission profile, Explorer can be launched on [[Electron]], [[Neutron]] or other launch vehicles. Explorer gained flight heritage during the [[027 - CAPSTONE]] mission to the Moon for [[NASA]] and forms the basis of the twin spacecraft Rocket Lab is developing for the [[ESCAPADE]] mission to Mars for NASA and the University of California, Berkeley.
