## Summary

Explorer is a high Delta-v spacecraft with large propellant tanks, deep space capable avionics, and ranging transponders. Explorer enables small spacecraft missions to planetary destinations like Mars and Venus, the Moon, highly eccentric Earth orbits, geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO), Earth-moon Lagrange points, Earth-sun Lagrange points, and near Earth objects (NEOs). Depending on the mission profile, Explorer can be launched on [[Electron]], [[Neutron]] or other launch vehicles. Explorer gained flight heritage during the [[CAPSTONE]] mission to the Moon for NASA and forms the basis of the twin spacecraft Rocket Lab is developing for the [[ESCAPADE]] mission to Mars for NASA and the University of California, Berkeley.

### Lunar Photon

#### Summary
**Lunar Photon** was developed as a high Delta-v variant of the [[Photon]] bus (now called Explorer) to deliver the [[#Payload|CAPSTONE]] spacecraft onto a ballistic transfer orbit to the Moon. As part of the mission, Lunar Photon, with Advanced Space‚Äôs CAPSTONE attached, orbited the Earth in elliptical phasing orbits over six days to build up velocity for a Trans Lunar Injection (TLI) to deploy CAPSTONE into the deep space, low energy transfer orbit to the vicinity of the Moon.

##### EESA 
EESA consists of two [electrostatic analyzers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_analyzer) to detect suprathermal ions (EESA-i) and electrons (EESA-e). EESA-i will measure ion energetics between 0.5 eV - 30 keV and EESA-e will measure electron energetics between 10 eV and 10 keV. Both instruments have an energy resolution (ŒîE/E) of 17% and angular resolution of 23¬∞x 23¬∞. EESA-e has a pitch-angle distribution (PAD) ranging from 20 - 160¬∞. EESA was developed by UCB SSL.
