## Summary

Photon is Rocket Lab’s flight proven, configurable spacecraft tailored for missions ranging from [[🌍 Orbits#LEO|low earth orbit]] through to planetary destinations. Photon is based on Rocket Lab’s heritage [[Electron#Kick Stage|Electron Kick Stage]], leveraging numerous components that have significant flight heritage, including the [[Curie]], an in-house designed and developed in-space propulsion system. Photon evolves the Kick Stage by incorporating high-power generation, high-accuracy attitude determination and control, enhanced propulsion subsystems, and radiation-tolerant avionics to provide a bundled launch-plus-satellite offering.

## New Lineup

In February 2024 Rocket Lab [announced their new Spacecraft lineup](https://rocketlabcorp.com/updates/new-blog-post-16/). Prior to this announcement, all spacecraft were named some variation of Photon (Photon Interplanetary, etc). In addition to Photon the lineup includes [[Explorer]], [[Lightning]], [[Pioneer]], and [[Flatellite]].
