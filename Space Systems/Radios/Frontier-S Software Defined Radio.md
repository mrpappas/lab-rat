## Key Features

- GEO/deep space radiation tolerance â€“ high tolerance to total dose, no destructive latchup, and robust to single event upsets 
- High Reliability variant available with enhanced radiation tolerance and upgraded parts program 
- Hardware critical command decoder (CCD) enables hardware-based functionality like fire- codes for spacecraft reset or precision time keeping 
- DSN, SN, NEN, AFSCN Unified S-band (USB), and commercial (SSC, KSAT) waveform compatible 
- CCSDS compliant turbo and convolutional encoding 
- Two-way Doppler and two-way ranging for navigation beyond low Earth orbit 
- Non-regenerative (coherent turn-around) or regenerative PN ranging 
- Very low data rates and beacon tones enable long range communications and signaling
