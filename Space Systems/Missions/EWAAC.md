>[!summary] EWAAC
>**Customer**: [[U.S. Air Force]]
**Contract Value**: $46 Billion (capped)
**Type**: IDIQ
**Period**: Through 2031
>
>The AFLCMC Armament Directorate has rolled out the Enterprise-Wide Agile Acquisition Contract (EWAAC) IDIQ, capped at $46B through 2031. This initiative is designed to rapidly cater to the [AFPEO](https://ww3.safaq.hq.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/430542/about-peocm/)'s weapons requirements, primarily emphasizing Armament and the Digital Trinity. Leveraging the provisions of [FAR part 16.5](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-16#FAR_Subpart_16_5), our goal is to expedite the acquisition process. It's important to note that this contract doesn't have predetermined funding. Instead, it will draw upon funds from both interagency collaborations and external agency allocations, as channeled via the AFPEO Weapons portfolio and supplementary program funds provided.
