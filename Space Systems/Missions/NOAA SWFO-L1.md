>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAAâ€™s) Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1 (SWFO-L1) includes a Rocket Lab-powered spacecraft built by [[Ball Aerospace]]. SWFO-L1 is expected to launch alongside the NASA [[GLIDE]] mission in 2025
>
SWFO-L1 is a [heliophysics](https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/) mission that will collect solar wind data and coronal imagery to meet [[NOAA]]â€™s operational requirements to monitor and forecast solar storm activity. SWFO-L1 will orbit the Sun at approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth on the Earth-Sun line, a point known as L1. As a next-generation space weather observing satellite, SWFO-L1 will monitor signs of solar storms and assess their potential impact on our planet's space infrastructure.
>
NOAA plans to launch the SWFO-L1 satellite to Earth-Sun Lagrange Point 1 in 2025 on the NASA Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe.
