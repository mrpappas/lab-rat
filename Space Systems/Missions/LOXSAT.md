>In 2020, Rocket Lab was selected by [[Eta Space]] to use [[Electron]] and [[Photon]] to conduct a flight demonstration of a complete cryogenic fluid management system in orbit for [[NASA]] - essentially, build, launch, and test a cryogenic fuel depot in low Earth orbit.
>
Through [NASA's Tipping Point program](https://newspaceeconomy.ca/2024/05/03/nasas-tipping-point-program-fostering-commercial-space-innovation/) to advance technologies that could, in future, support human space exploration, LOXSAT will test liquid oxygen storage technologies and collect critical fluid management data while in orbit for nine months, all the while supported by Rocket Lab's Photon spacecraft bus.
