>In 2022, Rocket Lab was selected by [[Ball Aerospace]] to manufacture the [[Substrates & Panels|Solar Array Panel (SAP)]] to power NASA’s Global Lyman-Alpha Imager of Dynamic Exosphere (GLIDE) spacecraft. GLIDE is a [heliophysics](https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/) mission intended to study variability in Earth’s atmosphere and is expected to launch in 2025.
>
The SAP will utilize [[SolAero Technologies]] by Rocket Lab’s high-efficiency, radiation-hardened, quadruple-junction [[Z4J solar cell]]s, laid down on carbon composite facesheet panels manufactured at the company’s facilities in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
>
Rocket Lab has provided power to multiple spacecraft as part of NASA’s Heliophysics Division missions including the Parker Solar Probe, the first-ever mission to “touch” the Sun that launched in 2018, and the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, a robotic space mission to study Earth’s magnetosphere that launched in 2015.
