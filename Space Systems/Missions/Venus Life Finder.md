Rocket Lab is sending the first private mission to Venus in search of supporting evidence of organic compounds in the cloud layer - traces of life. The goal, using an Electron launch vehicle and Photon spacecraft, is to send a probe to around 30 miles’ altitude, where Venus’ atmospheric conditions are closer to those found on Earth.
>
 While more than 30 Venus missions have been undertaken, Rocket Lab’s will be the first private exploration of the planet.
