**Curie** is a small, additively manufactured, storable, restart-able, pressure-fed bi-propellant engine integrated with lightweight composite propellant tanks and valves into a single compact module. Curie enables on orbit maneuvering and positioning, plane changes, and deorbit burns.

### HyperCurie

HyperCurie is an upgraded version of Rocket Lab’s original Curie engine. In contrast to the pressure-fed Curie, HyperCurie uses an electric pump-fed cycle and burns a [hypergolic propellant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergolic_propellant) (Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen (MON) and Monomethyl Hydrazine (MMH)), enabling reliable multiple restarts and higher performance for deep-space missions. It was first flown on Rocket Lab’s [[Explorer#Lunar Photon|Lunar Photon]] spacecraft during the [[CAPSTONE]] mission to the Moon in June 2022.

### Specific Impulse

Rocket Lab does not publicly disclose ISP of the Curie Engine but did give specifics for HyperCurie in the [CAPSTONE brochure](https://rocketlabcorp.com/assets/Uploads/EXC22_017%20-%20Photon%20Doc_%C6%92%20%5BWeb%5D.pdf),  [[Peter Beck]] also provided some details in a tweet, he also noted in another interview that HyperCurie has ~10 seconds more ISP than standard configuration. From that we can infer **300 and 310 seconds of ISP for Curie and HyperCurie** .

### Monopropellant 

Curie can be operated in a monopropellant configuration. Rocket Lab developed an in-house Viscus Liquid Monopropellant (VLM), [patented in 2012](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20120234196A1/en), but in a Reddit AMA [[Peter Beck]] confirmed that the kick stage **does [not use VLM](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/8a1wwy/comment/dwvf7yz/)**
