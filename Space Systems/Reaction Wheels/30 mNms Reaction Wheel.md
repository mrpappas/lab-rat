>[!summary]
>[[Sinclair Interplanetary]]â€™s first wheel design, and still the most popular. First launched in April 2008, there are now more than 50 units on-orbit. Many of these are onboard the University of Toronto SpaceFlight Lab's GNB series of spacecraft. They fit comfortably into a 6U to 12U cubesat.
