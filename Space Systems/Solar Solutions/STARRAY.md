>Rocket Lab‚Äôs Standardized Array (STARRAY) is a pre-engineered solution, providing customizable solar array solutions to meet the diverse power needs of satellites operating in any orbital condition. STARRAY can be configured into one, two, three or four panels per wing depending on requirements. STARRAY offers two voltage options of 45V and 62V at beginning of life (BOL), targeting end of life (EOL) options of approximately 36V and 50V for a typical missions lifecycle (end of life performance analysis can be provided upon request).

### For low mass satellites ranging from ~130W to ~390W BOL per wing (1 to 3 deployable panels per wing)

‚Ä¢ Up to three panels per wing
‚Ä¢ Single substrate size option of 750mm (along wing deployment
direction) x 840mm
‚Ä¢ Single hinge per panel
‚Ä¢ Panel thickness of 12mm with 12mm spacing, results in
maximum distance between spacecraft sidewall and most
extruded point of:
	 ‚Ä¢ 99mm for single panel
	 ‚Ä¢ 123mm for two panels
	 ‚Ä¢ 146mm for three panels
‚Ä¢ Approximate mass of 3.3 kg/m2 (without deployment
mechanisms) or 4.3 kg/m2 to 4.5 kg/m2 (including deployment
mechanisms) dependent on specific option size option and
number of panels per wing.
‚Ä¢ Electrical interface to spacecraft via rectangular GlenAir series
790 connector (pin count of 13, 33 and 43 for single, two and
three panels per wing respectively).

### BOL Vmp and size definition with wing power

| Voltage Option | Substrate Size (mm) | 1 Panel per Wing | 2 Panels per Wing | 3 Panels per Wing |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Vmp of 45V BOL | 750 x 840           | 137 W            | 274 W             | 410 W             |
| Vmp of 62V BOL | 750 x 840           | 132 W            | 263 W             | 393 W             |

### For high power satellites ranging from ~180W to ~1800W BOL per wing (1 to 4 deployable panels per wing)

‚Ä¢ Up to four panels per wing
‚Ä¢ 7 panel size options
‚Ä¢ Length (along wing deployment direction) 541mm, 667mm,
and 800mm; Width: 1198mm, 1479mm, 1619mm, 1760mm, 1900mm
‚Ä¢ Panel thickness of 18mm with 18mm spacing, resulting in
maximum distance between spacecraft sidewall and most
extruded point of:
	 ‚Ä¢ 95mm for single panel
	 ‚Ä¢ 131mm for two panels
	 ‚Ä¢ 167mm for three panels
	 ‚Ä¢ 203mm for four panels
‚Ä¢ A yoke adds 36mm to the total stowed wing thickness
‚Ä¢ Yokes can be added depending on the specific configurations
required.
‚Ä¢ Approximate mass of 4.3 kg/m2 to 5.8 kg/m2 (without deployment
mechanisms) or 5.4 kg/m2 to 10.4 kg/m2 (including deployment
mechanisms) dependent on specific option size option and
number of panels per wing. A yoke will add between 1.9kg and 2.3kg
depending on the specific configuration.
‚Ä¢ Electrical interface to spacecraft via rectangular GlenAir Series 28
connector with a pin count of 37 contacts without yoke and via
circular D39888 connectors if yoke is included in design.
