## Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a type of active data collection where an instrument sends out a pulse of energy and then records the amount of that energy reflected back after it interacts with Earth. Unlike optical imagery, which is a passive data collection technique based on emitted energy, SAR imagery is created from the reaction of an emitted pulse of energy with physical structures (like mountains, forests, and sea ice) and conditions like soil moisture. SAR has been used in a wide range of applications, including studying Antarctic icebergs, tracking the paths of oil spills into sensitive marshes, and mapping the wetlands of Alaska.

## Internet of Things (IoT)

IoT Satellites (Internet of Things satellites) are specialized small satellites designed to facilitate global connectivity for IoT devices. These satellites provide low-cost, low-power, and widespread data connectivity, making them suitable for remote and inaccessible areas where terrestrial networks like cellular or Wi-Fi are unavailable or impractical.
