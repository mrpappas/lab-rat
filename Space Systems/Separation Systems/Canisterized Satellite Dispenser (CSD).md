## 📜 Heritage

The CSD is at [Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 9](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/technology-readiness-levels/). A 3U CSD flew aboard the inaugural Falcon 9 v1.1 flight on September 2013 and released the 7-piece POPACS payload in orbit.

Over 30 missions on Falcon 9, [[Electron]], Atlas V, Antares, Minotaur IV, and more.

## 🛠️ Features

| Feature                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Preloaded Payload Tabs**                      | Preload means the payload can’t jiggle and damage itself. Creates a modelable load path to the payload so strength at critical locations like reaction wheel bearings can be accurately calculated. |
| **Low Tip-Off**                                 | Payloads stabilize rapidly. Precision tabs, roller bearings, and a linear way combine to minimize disturbance torques.                                                                              |
| **Six Mountable Sides**                         | Greatly reduces the cost, complexity, and mass of adjoining structures and interface plates to the launch vehicle.                                                                                  |
| **Motor Driven Initiator**                      | Creates the lowest cost, most reliable dispensing mechanism that resets in seconds without consumables.                                                                                             |
| **Robust Structural Design**                    | Withstands extreme shock, vibration, and thermal environments.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Payload Electrical Connector**                | Allows communication and charging between payload and launch vehicle prior to and during launch.                                                                                                    |
| **Conductive External Surfaces**                | Prevents surface charging.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **CSD-Constrained Deployables**                 | Greatly reduces the cost and complexity of payload deployables like solar panels and antennas by using the CSD’s internal walls to constrain instead of burn wires.                                 |
| **Complete Payload Separation**                 | Demonstrates whole system reliability during testing.                                                                                                                                               |

| **P-Pod Compatible Mounting Interface**         | Ensures compatibility with existing structures.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Full Length, Constant-Force Ejection Spring** | Ensures positive, constant force margin throughout ejection.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Lowest External Volume**                      | Increases packaging density on launch vehicle.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Largest Internal Volume**                     | Payloads have 15% more volume and can be 1 inch longer than standard CubeSats.                                                                                                                      |
| **Safe/Arm Access on Front Door**               | Ensures access to payload at all times.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Flight Validated**                            | Attained TRL 9 with flight heritage in 2013.                                                                                                                                                        |
