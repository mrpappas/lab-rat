## Features

| **Feature**                        | **Description** |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Preloaded Payload Tabs**          | A modelable load path to the payload enables strength at critical locations like reaction wheel bearings to be accurately calculated. |
| **Customizable Payload Volume**     | Payloadâ€™s tabs are the only required mechanical interface. If not utilizing walls, the payload volume can significantly increase. |
| **Low Tip-Off**                     | Payloads stabilize rapidly. Precision tabs and a linear way combine to minimize separation disturbance torques. |
| **Motor Driven Initiator**          | Creates the lowest cost, most reliable dispensing mechanism that resets in seconds without consumables. |
| **Robust Structural Design**        | Withstands extreme shock, vibration, and thermal environments. |
| **Payload Electrical Connector**    | Allows communication and charging between payload and launch vehicle prior to and during launch. |
| **Conductive External Surfaces**    | Prevents surface charging. |
| **ASD-Constrained Deployables**     | Greatly reduces the cost and complexity of payload deployables like solar panels and antennas by using the ASDâ€™s internal walls to constrain instead of burn wires. |
| **Complete Payload Separation**     | Demonstrates whole system reliability during testing. |
| **Manual Door Release**             | Allows the ASD to be opened without releasing the payload. |
| **Constant-Force Ejection Spring**  | Ensures positive, constant force margin throughout ejection. |
| **Low External Volume**             | Increases packaging density on launch vehicle. |
| **Largest Internal Volume**         | Payloads have 25% more volume and can be longer than standard CubeSats. |
| **Fully Removable Walls**           | Ensures access to payload. |
| **Reverse Polarity Protection**     | Ensures deployment even if electrical polarity is reversed. |
| **State Switch**                    | Indicates payload occupancy and enables calculating dispensing velocity. |
| **Fully Documented**                | Mechanical and electrical interfaces and CAD models available for download allowing rapid and low-cost design. |
| **Parametric Design**               | Commonality allows users easy understanding of electro-mechanical interface for 6U and 12U sizes. |
| **Lowest Cost**                     | Reduced mission cost through simplified design, test, and integration. |
