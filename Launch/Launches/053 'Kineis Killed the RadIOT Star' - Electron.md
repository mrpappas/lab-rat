Rocket Lab launched the “Kinéis Killed the RadIOT Star” mission from Rocket Lab [[Launch Complex 1]] Pad A on 21st September, 2024.  The launch was a dedicated mission for [[Kinéis]], a French Internet of Things (IoT) company.
>
“Kinéis Killed the RadIOT Star” was the second of five dedicated [[Electron]] launches for Kinéis (the first mission, ‘[[050 'No Time Toulouse' - Electron]],’ successfully launched on June 19, 2024). Across all five launches, Rocket Lab will deploy [[Kinéis]]’ complete constellation of 25 satellites. “Kinéis Killed the RadIOT Star” was Rocket Lab’s 53rd [[Electron]] launch and brought the total number of satellites launched by the company to 192.

[[Kinéis]]’ constellation will connect any object anywhere in the world and guarantee the transmission of targeted and useful data to users, in near-real time, with low energy consumption with more powerful 30kg-class nanosats that integrate IoT technology.
