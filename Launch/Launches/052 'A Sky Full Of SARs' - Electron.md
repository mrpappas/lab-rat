Rocket Lab launched a dedicated mission for [[Capella Space]], a provider of SAR imagery data and solutions for government and commercial applications.

‘A Sky Full of SARs’ was Rocket Lab’s fifth launch overall for [[Capella Space]] across multiple launch contracts beginning from 2020. The mission deployed Capella’s Acadia-3 SAR satellite, a synthetic aperture radar satellite for Earth imagery and observation, to a mid-inclination 615km circular orbit to add to Capella’s existing SAR satellite constellation in low Earth orbit.
