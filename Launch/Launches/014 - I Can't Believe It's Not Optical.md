>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary] 
‚ÄòI Can‚Äôt Believe It‚Äôs Not Optical‚Äô was a dedicated mission for Capella Space, an information services company providing Earth observation data on demand.
>
Capella‚Äôs payload, ‚ÄòSequoia‚Äô, is a single 100 kg class microsatellite which will be the first publicly available satellite in the company‚Äôs commercial Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) constellation. By positioning the satellite to a 45-degree inclination, Capella Space will maximize coverage over important areas such as the Middle East, Korea, Japan, Europe, South East Asia, Africa, and the U.S.
>
The mission name is a nod to Capella‚Äôs SAR technology that provides high quality images of the Earth day or night, and in any weather conditions. Capella‚Äôs space-based radar can detect sub-0.5 meter changes on the surface of the Earth, providing insights and data that can be used for security, agricultural and infrastructure monitoring, as well as disaster response and recovery.
