The “Owl The Way Up” mission launched from Rocket Lab [[Launch Complex 1]] in Mahia, New Zealand to deploy a single StriX satellite to orbit for [[Synspective]]. The mission was the sixth in a total of 16 launches booked on [[Electron]] for Synspective, a Japanese Earth observation company operating a constellation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites designed to deliver imagery that can detect millimetre-level changes to the Earth’s surface from space. Rocket Lab first launched for Synspective in December 2020 and has been the sole launch provider for Synspective’s constellation to date.
