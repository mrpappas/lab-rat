## Mission Summary 

>[!success] Mission Success

Rocket Lab’s 16th Electron launch 'Return to Sender' successfully launched November 20, 02:20 UTC from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand.

The Electron launch vehicle lofted 30 satellites to a sun-synchronous orbit at 500 km altitude for a range of customers, including [[TriSept]], [[Unseenlabs]], [[Swarm]], Auckland Programme for Space Systems, and global gaming software company [[Valve]]. 

This mission also included Rocket Lab's first attempt to bring Electron’s first stage back to Earth under a parachute system for a controlled water landing before collection by a recovery vessel - a major milestone in Rocket Lab’s pursuit to make Electron a reusable rocket to support an increased launch cadence for small satellites.
