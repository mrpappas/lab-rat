>[!success] Mission Success

The “It Argos Up From Here” mission launched the [[General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems]] designed and manufactured satellite carrying the Argos-4 Advanced Data Collection System (A-DCS) hosted payload. The A-DCS mission is supported by the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://www.noaa.gov/) Cooperative Data and Rescue Services Program, which arranged the launch through the Hosted Payload Solutions contract vehicle administered by the [[U.S. Space Force]]’s Space Systems Command.

This dedicated mission for General Atomics launched the GAzelle satellite carrying Argos-4 from Pad B at Launch Complex 1.
