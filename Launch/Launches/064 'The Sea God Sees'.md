>[!summary]
'The Sea God Sees' is Rocket Lab's third mission for Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space, Inc. ([[iQPS]]), an Earth-imaging company from Japan.
>
'The Sea God Sees’ will launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand during a launch window that opens on May 17, 2025. The mission will launch a single synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging satellite called QPS-SAR-10 (nicknamed “WADATSUMI-I” for the Japanese god of the sea) to a 575km circular Earth orbit, from where the satellite will join the rest of the [[iQPS]] constellation in providing high resolution images and Earth monitoring services globally.
>
The mission will be the third overall Electron launch for [[iQPS]] and the second in a line-up of eight dedicated missions across 2025 and 2026 to deploy [[iQPS]]’s constellation.
