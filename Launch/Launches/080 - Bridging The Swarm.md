>[!summary] NEONSAT-1A /  Verifier 
>The NeonSat-1A, carrying a high-resolution optical camera, is designed to test the constellation capabilities of the South Korean government's Earth observation micro-satellite constellation NEONSAT (New-space Earth Observation Satellite), in particular technology improvements identified from operations of NeonSat-1 after its [[047 - Beginning Of The Swarm|launch in April 2024]]. These technologies will in turn be incorporated into the next 10 NEONSAT under construction, as well as providing more site re-visiting capabilities along with NEONSAT-1.
