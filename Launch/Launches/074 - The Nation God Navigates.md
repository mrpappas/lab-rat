>[!success] Mission Success

"The Nation God Navigates” launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 19:51 UTC on November 5, 2025, deploying QPS-SAR-14, nicknamed YACHIHOKO-I for the Japanese god of nation-building, to a 575km circular Earth orbit. This satellite joins the rest of the QPS-SAR constellation in providing high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and Earth monitoring services globally. iQPS aims to build a constellation of 36 SAR satellites that will provide near-real-time images of Earth every 10 minutes.

"The Nation God Navigates" was the sixth mission deployed on Electron for iQPS, making Rocket Lab the go-to provider for their constellation.
