>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
The STP-27RD mission was Rocket Lab’s sixth mission and the company’s second launch of 2019. Lifting-off from [[Launch Complex 1]], the mission lofted three research and development satellites for the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s Space Test Program. 
>
The Space Plug and Play Architecture Research CubeSat-1 (SPARC-1) payload, sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory Space vehicles Directorate (AFRL/RV), was a joint Swedish-United States experiment to explore technology developments in avionics miniaturization, software defined radio systems, and space situational awareness (SSA). 
>
The Falcon Orbital Debris Experiment (Falcon ODE), sponsored by the United States Air Force Academy, evaluated ground-based tracking of space objects. 
>
The final payload was the 150kg Harbinger satellite; a commercial small satellite built by York Space Systems and sponsored by the U.S Army to demonstrate the ability of an experimental commercial system to meet DoD space capability requirements.
