## Mission Summary

>[!success]  Mission Success

“Full Stream Ahead”, will launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand during a launch window that opens on May 28th, 2025 UTC.

The mission will launch the next of BlackSky’s Gen-3 satellites to a mid-inclination circular 470km orbit, where it will join the remainder of the company’s constellation delivering very high-resolution imagery and AI-enabled analytics for daily intelligence operations.

“Full Stream Ahead” is the second in a series of four Electron launches booked by BlackSky to deploy its Gen-3 satellites to orbit this year, and the tenth overall launch for the company – making Electron the most prolific launcher for their constellation to date.
