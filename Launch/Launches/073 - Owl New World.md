>[!success] Mission Success

"Owl New World" was Rocket Lab's next dedicated Electron launch for Synspective, a leading Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data and analytics company from Japan.

"Owl New World" launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on October 14, UTC / October 15, NZDT. The mission deployed a single StriX satellite to a 583km low Earth orbit to join Synspective's SAR constellation providing high-frequency, high-resolution Earth observation data for disaster response and management, national security, and environmental monitoring.

“Owl New World” was Rocket Lab’s seventh launch for Synspective and the first in a series of 21 upcoming missions to deploy the company’s Earth-imaging constellation before the end of the decade. Electron has already successfully deployed six StriX satellites across six dedicated missions as the constellation’s sole launch provider to date.

The mission was Rocket Lab’s 15th launch this year and 73rd launch overall.
