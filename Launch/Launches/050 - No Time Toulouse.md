## Mission Summary

>[!Success] Mission Success

The ‘No Time Toulouse’ mission was our milestone 50th [[Electron]] launch that launched on June 19th, 2024 from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand.

The mission was the first of five dedicated Electron launches for [[Kinéis]], a company backed by private and public investors including the French government’s space agency CNES (Centre National d'Études Spatiales) and CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites) an international space-based solutions provider, to improve global IoT connectivity. Kinéis’ new constellation will connect any object anywhere in the world and guarantee the transmission of targeted and useful data to users, in near-real time, with low energy consumption with more powerful 30kg-class nanosats that integrate IoT technology.  The constellation also includes a second mission: a ship-tracking Automatic Identification System (AIS). Once deployed, these technologies will allow Kinéis to expand across multiple industries and scale from 20,000 devices connected to millions.
