>[!Success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
The ‚ÄòNo Time Toulouse‚Äô mission was our milestone 50th [[Electron]] launch that launched on June 19th, 2024 from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand.
>
The mission was the first of five dedicated Electron launches for [[Kin√©is]], a company backed by private and public investors including the French government‚Äôs space agency CNES (Centre National d'√âtudes Spatiales) and CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites) an international space-based solutions provider, to improve global IoT connectivity. Kin√©is‚Äô new constellation will connect any object anywhere in the world and guarantee the transmission of targeted and useful data to users, in near-real time, with low energy consumption with more powerful 30kg-class nanosats that integrate IoT technology.  The constellation also includes a second mission: a ship-tracking Automatic Identification System (AIS). Once deployed, these technologies will allow Kin√©is to expand across multiple industries and scale from 20,000 devices connected to millions.
