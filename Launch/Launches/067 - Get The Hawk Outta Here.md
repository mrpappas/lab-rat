>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
‚ÄòGet The Hawk Outta Here‚Äô launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 at 17:28 UTC on June 26th for customer HawkEye 360, a radio frequency geospatial analytics provider based in Virginia.
>
The mission deployed four satellites for HawkEye 360: a trio of microsats to collect and geolocate radio frequency signals from around the world, and Kestrel-0A, an experimental satellite designed to evaluate emerging capabilities and future technology enhancements. The three satellites comprising HawkEye 360‚Äôs Cluster 12 will operate in a dawn-to-dusk polar orbit ‚Äî filling a critical coverage gap and enhancing the company‚Äôs ability to extract RF intelligence in regions of strategic interest.
>
‚ÄòGet The Hawk Outta Here‚Äô was the second of three missions on Electron in a multi-launch contract to build out HawkEye 360‚Äôs constellation. The first mission in January 2023, ‚ÄòVirginia Is For Launch Lovers,‚Äô deployed HawkEye‚Äôs Cluster 6 satellites to orbit on Electron‚Äôs inaugural launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia.
>
All of HawkEye 360‚Äôs satellites launched on Electron are deployed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs own Lightband satellite separation system.
