The mission launched a single [[üì¶ Payload Types#Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)]] imaging satellite to a 575km circular Earth orbit for iQPS called QPS-SAR-9 (nicknamed ‚ÄúSUSANOO-I‚Äù). The spacecraft joined iQPS‚Äô growing Earth-imaging constellation that delivers high-resolution monitoring from specific locations every 10 minutes. 
>
‚ÄòThe Lightning God Reigns‚Äô was the first of eight upcoming launches for iQPS across 2025 and 2026 to build out iQPS‚Äòs constellation, and follows the Company‚Äôs [[042 - The Moon God Awakens|earlier successful mission]] for iQPS launched in December 2023. Each upcoming mission includes a Rocket Lab Motorized Lightband, used to separate and deploy the satellite from Electron once in space.
