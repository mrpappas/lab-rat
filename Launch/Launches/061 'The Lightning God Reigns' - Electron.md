>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
>‚ÄúThe Lightning God Reigns‚Äù launched from Rocket Lab‚Äôs private orbital launch site, Rocket Lab [[Launch Complex 1]], in New Zealand during a launch window that opened on March 14th UTC. 
>
The mission launched a single synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging satellite to a 575km circular Earth orbit for iQPS called QPS-SAR-9 (nicknamed ‚ÄúSUSANOO-I‚Äù). The spacecraft joined [[iQPS]]‚Äô growing Earth-imaging constellation that delivers high-resolution monitoring from specific locations every 10 minutes. 
>
‚ÄòThe Lightning God Reigns‚Äô is the first of eight upcoming launches for iQPS across 2025 and 2026 to build out iQPS‚Äòs constellation, and follows the Company‚Äôs earlier successful mission for iQPS launched in December 2023. Each upcoming mission includes a Rocket Lab Motorized Lightband, used to separate and deploy the satellite from Electron once in space.
