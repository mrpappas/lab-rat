>[!warning] Mission Pending

>[!info] December 11 launch scrubbed

Electron's 78th mission, ‘Bridging The Swarm’, is scheduled to launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand during a launch window that opens on December 16 UTC.

‘Bridging The Swarm’ is a dedicated launch for the [Satellite Technology Research Center (SaTReC)](https://satrec.kaist.ac.kr/e_01_01.php) at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ([[KAIST]]), Korea’s leading university dedicated to science and technology. The mission will deploy NEONSAT-1A, an advanced Earth observation satellite equipped with a high-resolution optical camera. 

Designed to capture near-real time natural disaster monitoring for the Korean peninsula, KAIST’s NEONSAT constellation is a collaboration across multiple Korean academic, industry, and research institutions, including SaTReC, which is leading the program’s system design and engineering. The NEONSAT program is funded by the Korean government’s Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT).

>[!summary] NEONSAT-1A /  Verifier 
>The NeonSat-1A, carrying a high-resolution optical camera, is designed to test the constellation capabilities of the South Korean government's Earth observation micro-satellite constellation NEONSAT (New-space Earth Observation Satellite), in particular technology improvements identified from operations of NeonSat-1 after its [[047 - Beginning Of The Swarm|launch in April 2024]]. These technologies will in turn be incorporated into the next 10 NEONSAT under construction, as well as providing more site re-visiting capabilities along with NEONSAT-1.
