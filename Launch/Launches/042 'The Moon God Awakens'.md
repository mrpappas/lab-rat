>[!Success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
Rocket Lab launched a dedicated Electron mission for the Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space, Inc. ([[iQPS]]), a Japan-based Earth imaging company. 
>
The mission carried iQPS‚Äôs QPS-SAR-5 satellite named ‚ÄúTSUKUYOMI-I‚Äù into orbit on a dedicated Electron mission from Rocket Lab [[Launch Complex 1]] in Mahia, New Zealand. The mission has been named ‚ÄúThe Moon God Awakens‚Äù in acknowledgement of Tsukuyomi, the Japanese God of the Moon.
>
QPS-SAR-5 is a [[üì¶ Payload Types#Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)]] satellite that joins iQPS's QPS-SAR-6 satellite already in orbit. iQPS‚Äôs satellites are small, high-performance SAR satellites that use a lightweight, large, stowable antenna to collect high resolution images of Earth, even through clouds and adverse weather conditions. Ultimately, the iQPS constellation is planned to have 36 satellites capable of monitoring specific fixed points on Earth every 10 minutes.
>
In addition to being launched by Electron, the QPS-SAR-5 satellite used Rocket Lab‚Äôs Mark II Motorized Lightband (MLB) as its separation system demonstrating the Company‚Äôs vertically integrated space systems strategy.
