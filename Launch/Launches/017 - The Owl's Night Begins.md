>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
Rocket Lab's 17th mission was a dedicated launch for Japanese Earth-imaging company Synspective.
>
The mission was named ‚ÄòThe Owl‚Äôs Night Begins‚Äô in a nod to Synspective‚Äôs StriX family of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) spacecraft developed to be able to image millimetre-level changes to the Earth‚Äôs surface from space, independent of weather conditions on Earth and at any time of the day or night. Strix is also the genus of owls.
>
The StriX-Œ± satellite onboard this mission was the first of a series of spacecraft deployments for Synspective‚Äôs planned constellation of more than 30 SAR small satellites to collate data of metropolitan centers across Asia on a daily basis that can be used for urban development planning, construction and infrastructure monitoring, and disaster response.
