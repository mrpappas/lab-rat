>[!summary]
“The Beat Goes On” mission launched two of [[BlackSky]]’s Gen-2 Earth-imaging satellites from Pad B at Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand and brought the total number of satellites delivered by Electron to orbit to 159.

The pair of high-resolution, multi-spectral, Gen-2 satellites launched on [[Electron]] expanded BlackSky’s network in space and its offering of real-time geospatial intelligence and monitoring services. BlackSky combines high-resolution images captured by its constellation of microsatellites with its proprietary artificial intelligence software to deliver analytics and insights to industries including transportation, infrastructure, land use, defense, supply chain management, and humanitarian aid.
