>[!summary]
‚ÄòThe Owl‚Äôs Night Continues‚Äô was the first of three dedicated Electron missions for [[Synspective]], with two scheduled to launch in 2022 and a third in 2023. Each mission will deploy a single [[Synspective#üõ∞Ô∏è Space Systems#StriX|StriX]] satellite, growing [[Synspective]]‚Äôs [[üì¶ Payload Types#Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)|Synthetic Aperture Rader (SAR)]] constellation developed to deliver imagery that can detect millimetre-level changes to the Earth‚Äôs surface from space, independent of weather conditions on Earth and at any time of the day or night.

‚ÄòThe Owl‚Äôs Night Continues‚Äô mission follows on from Rocket Lab‚Äôs first launch for Synspective in December 2020. That mission, named ‚ÄòThe Owl‚Äôs Night Begins‚Äô, saw Rocket Lab‚Äôs Electron launch vehicle deploy the StriX-Œ± satellite ‚Äì the first spacecraft in Synspective‚Äôs planned constellation of more than 30 SAR satellites designed to collate data of metropolitan centers on a daily basis to support urban development planning, construction and infrastructure monitoring, and disaster response.
