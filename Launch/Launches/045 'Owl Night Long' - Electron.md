Synspective is a satellite data solutions provider with its own constellation of SAR satellites. [[📦 Payload Types#Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)|Synthetic Aperture Rader (SAR)]] is an active system that transmits microwave pulses toward the Earth's surface and receives the reflected signals to create an image of the target area. Unlike other imaging technologies, SAR can penetrate clouds and other atmospheric conditions, enabling it to collect data day or night with frequent revisit rates.
