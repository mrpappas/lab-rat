>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
>‘Fasten Your Space Belts’ was Rocket Lab’s first of multiple new missions for [[BlackSky]]. The mission introduced their newest 35cm high-resolution Gen-3 satellites to orbit, allowing them to greatly enhance and optimize their geospatial intelligence capabilities.
Like earlier Black Sky launches on [[Electron]], this mission was supported by a Rocket Lab manufactured [[Motorized Lightband]] separation systems for the satellite to attach to and deploy from Electron once in space.
'Fasten Your Space Belts' was the ninth launch for BlackSky since 2019, making Rocket Lab the most prolific launch provider for BlackSky’s constellation to date.
