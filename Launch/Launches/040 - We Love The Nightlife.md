>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
The ‚ÄòWe Love the Nightlife‚Äô mission launched from Rocket Lab [[Launch Complex 1]] on August 24, 2023 on New Zealand‚Äôs Mahia Peninsula for American space tech company Capella Space (Capella), a leading provider of commercial Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery.
>
‚ÄòWe Love the Nightlife‚Äô was Rocket Lab‚Äôs third launch for Capella following the successful ‚ÄúStronger Together‚Äù mission launched in March 2023 from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia, USA, and the ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Believe It‚Äôs Not Optical‚Äù mission in August 2020 from Launch Complex 1, which deployed the first satellite in Capella‚Äôs SAR constellation.
>
The mission was also a recovery mission, with Electron's first stage brought back to Earth under a parachute for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean for retrieval. **For the first time, Rocket Lab also launched with a pre-flown Rutherford engine** - a significant milestone in the program to evolve Electron into a reusable rocket.
