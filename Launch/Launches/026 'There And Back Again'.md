>[!summary]
Launched from Pad A at Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 on New Zealand’s Mahia Peninsula, the “There And Back Again” mission was Rocket Lab’s 26th Electron launch.
>
The “There And Back Again” mission deployed 34 satellites to a sun synchronous orbit for a variety of customers including [[Alba Orbital]], [[Astrix Astronautics]], [[Aurora Propulsion Technologies]], [[E-Space]], [[Spaceflight]] Inc., and [[Unseenlabs]], and brought the total number of satellites launched by Electron to 146.
>
“There And Back Again” was also a recovery mission where, for the first time, Rocket Lab caught Electron’s first stage as it returned from space under parachutes using a helicopter. The successful catch brings Electron one step closer to being the first reusable orbital small sat launcher.
