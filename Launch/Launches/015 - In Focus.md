>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
'In Focus' was a rideshare mission to low Earth orbit for [[Planet Labs]] and Spaceflight Inc.‚Äôs customer [[Canon Electronics]]. The mission deployed a total of 10 satellites to precise and individual orbits from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand.
>
Planet had nine of their latest generation SuperDove satellites deployed to a 500km morning-crossing Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO). Each of the nine SuperDoves were integrated with and deployed from Rocket Lab‚Äôs [[Maxwell CubeSat Dispenser]]s, the industry‚Äôs lightest CubeSat dispenser in its class. Planet‚Äôs Flock 4e‚Äô of SuperDoves join the company‚Äôs constellation of Earth-observation satellites already on orbit providing medium-resolution global coverage and near-daily revisit.
>
The 10th and final payload, Canon Electronics Inc.‚Äôs CE-SAT-IIB, was arranged by satellite rideshare and mission management provider Spaceflight Inc. CE-SAT-IIB is a technical demonstration microsatellite developed by Canon Electronics Inc. It has a middle-size telescope equipped with an ultra-high sensitivity camera to take night images of the Earth and small size telescopes which are suitable for CubeSat use.
