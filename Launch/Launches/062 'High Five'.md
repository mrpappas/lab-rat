>[!warning] Scheduled to Launch March 18th

>[!summary]
The "High Five" mission will launch from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand to deploy five satellites for French IoT company Kinéis and complete the delivery of their entire constellation to orbit in less than a year.
>
The mission is the fifth of five dedicated Electron launches for Kinéis. The previous missions were successfully launched on Electron from Launch Complex 1 in June, September, and November of 2024, as well as February 2025. Each launch deployed five Internet-of-Things (IOT) satellites.
>
Across these five launches in total, Rocket Lab will deploy Kinéis’ complete constellation of 25 satellites. The launch has been tailored specifically to meet Kinéis’ mission requirements, giving them greater control over launch schedule, orbit, and deployment parameters than would be possible on a larger rideshare mission.
