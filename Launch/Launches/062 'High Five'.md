>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
The "High Five" mission launched from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand to deploy five satellites for French IoT company Kin√©is and complete the delivery of their entire constellation to orbit in less than a year.
>
The mission was the fifth of five dedicated Electron launches for Kin√©is. The previous missions were successfully launched on Electron from Launch Complex 1 in June, September, and November of 2024, as well as February 2025. Each launch deployed five Internet-of-Things (IOT) satellites.
>
Across these five launches in total, Rocket Lab deployed Kin√©is‚Äô complete constellation of 25 satellites. The launch has been tailored specifically to meet Kin√©is‚Äô mission requirements, giving them greater control over launch schedule, orbit, and deployment parameters than would be possible on a larger rideshare mission.
