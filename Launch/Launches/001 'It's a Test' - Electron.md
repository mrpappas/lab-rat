>[!summary]
**It's a Test** was the first flight of Rocket Lab's Electron launch vehicle. The mission, launched from [[Launch Complex 1]] on New Zealand's Mahia Peninsula, marked a significant milestone as the first orbital-class rocket launched from a private launch site.

Despite not reaching orbit, the mission successfully demonstrated key systems including a perfect first stage burn, stage separation, second stage ignition, and fairing separation, putting Rocket Lab in a strong position for future commercial operations.

## ✏️ Notes

 - "Rocket Lab’s investigation team determined the launch, named ‘It’s a Test’, was terminated due to a data loss time out, which was caused by misconfiguration of telemetry equipment owned and operated by a third-party contractor who was supporting the launch from Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1."
 - Being the first [[Electron]] launch, there was no customer payload.
