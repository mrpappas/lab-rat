>[!success] Mission Success

"Don't Be Such A Square" will launch the Space Test Program [[STP-S30]] mission for the [[U.S. Space Force]] Space Systems Command from [[Launch Complex 2]] on Wallops Island, Virginia.

The STP-S30 mission will deploy the first DiskSats to space: a disk-shaped spacecraft platform developed by The Aerospace Corporation (Aerospace) and funded by NASA that offers an alternative approach to small satellites. Electron will deliver the constellation of four DiskSats to a 550km low Earth orbit where Aerospace will test their maneuverability, launch dispenser mechanism and orbit-changing capabilities using electric propulsion - key features in flexible, responsive space operations.

‘Don’t Be Such A Square will be Electron’s 20th launch of the year and 78th mission overall.
