>[!summary]
The NROL-123 mission, called ‘Live And Let Fly’,was Rocket Lab’s first launch for the [[National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)]] from the United States after previously launching four NRO missions from Launch Complex 1 on New Zealand’s Mahia Peninsula. It was Rocket Lab’s 4th mission from [[Launch Complex 2]], a dedicated pad for the Electron rocket located at Virginia Spaceport Authority's Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport within the NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.  
>
The ‘Live And Let Fly’ launch service was acquired using NRO’s Rapid Acquisition of a Small Rocket (RASR) contract. RASR enables the NRO to explore new opportunities for launching small satellites through a streamlined, commercial approach. NRO missions provide critical information to more than a half-million government users, including every member of the Intelligence Community, two dozen domestic agencies, the military, lawmakers, and decision makers.
