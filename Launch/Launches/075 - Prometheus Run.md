>[!success] Mission Success

"Prometheus Run" was Rocket Lab's latest launch on [[HASTE]] - our commercial launch vehicle for regular and reliable hypersonic test flights - which took place from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 on Wallops Island, Virginia at TIME on DATE

Led by Missile Defense Agency ([[MDA]]) through the Defense Innovation Unit's (DIU) [HyCAT program](https://www.diu.mil/latest/diu-awards-first-contracts-for-prototyping-low-cost-high-cadence-long), the mission deployed a government-provided primary payload developed by the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and multiple secondary payloads by federal and industry partners, which tested key technologies for missile defense applications.

The mission was Rocket Lab’s sixth launch of its HASTE rocket since the launch [[038 - Scout's Arrow|vehicle’s debut in 2023]]. A suborbital variant of Electron - the world’s most frequently launched small orbital rocket - HASTE includes much of the same innovative technology as Electron, including carbon fiber composite structures and 3D printed rocket engines, but has a modified upper Kick Stage tailored for hypersonic technology tests and a larger payload capacity. HASTE can deploy technologies at speeds of more than 7.5km per second to test air-breathing, glide, and ballistic payloads, as well as technologies to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere from space. Combined, the HASTE and Electron launch vehicles have deployed 200+ payloads for government and commercial customers to date.
