>[!summary]
“The Lightning God Reigns” launched from Rocket Lab’s private orbital launch site, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1, in New Zealand on March 15, 2025 at 1:00 p.m. NZDT (00:00 UTC)
>
The mission launched a single [[📦 Payload Types#Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)]] imaging satellite to a 575km circular Earth orbit for iQPS called QPS-SAR-9 (nicknamed “SUSANOO-I”). The spacecraft joined iQPS’ growing Earth-imaging constellation that delivers high-resolution monitoring from specific locations every 10 minutes. 
>
‘The Lightning God Reigns’ was the first of eight upcoming launches for iQPS across 2025 and 2026 to build out iQPS‘s constellation, and follows the Company’s [[042 'The Moon God Awakens'|earlier successful mission]] for iQPS launched in December 2023. Each upcoming mission includes a Rocket Lab Motorized Lightband, used to separate and deploy the satellite from Electron once in space.
