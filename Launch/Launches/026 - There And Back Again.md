>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
Launched from Pad A at Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 on New Zealand‚Äôs Mahia Peninsula, the ‚ÄúThere And Back Again‚Äù mission was Rocket Lab‚Äôs 26th Electron launch.
>
The ‚ÄúThere And Back Again‚Äù mission deployed 34 satellites to a sun synchronous orbit for a variety of customers including [[Alba Orbital]], [[Astrix Astronautics]], [[Aurora Propulsion Technologies]], [[E-Space]], [[Spaceflight]] Inc., and [[Unseenlabs]], and brought the total number of satellites launched by Electron to 146.
>
‚ÄúThere And Back Again‚Äù was also a recovery mission where, for the first time, Rocket Lab caught Electron‚Äôs first stage as it returned from space under parachutes using a helicopter. The successful catch brings Electron one step closer to being the first reusable orbital small sat launcher.
