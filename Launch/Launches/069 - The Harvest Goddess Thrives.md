‘The Harvest Goddess Thrives’ was the fifth mission on Electron for multi-launch customer Japan-based Earth imaging company, Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space, Inc. ([[iQPS]]).

The mission deployed [[iQPS#QPS-SAR|QPS-SAR-12]], nicknamed KUSHINADA-I for the Japanese goddess of harvest and prosperity, to a 575km circular Earth orbit to join the rest of the QPS-SAR constellation in providing high resolution synthetic aperture radar images and Earth monitoring services globally.
