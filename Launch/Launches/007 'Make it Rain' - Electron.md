>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
The Make It Rain mission launched multiple spacecraft as part of a rideshare flight procured by Spaceflight. The launch took place from Rocket Lab [[Launch Complex 1]] on New Zealand’s Māhia Peninsula.
>
The mission was named ‘Make it Rain’ in a nod to the high volume of rainfall in Seattle, where [[Spaceflight]] is headquartered, as well in New Zealand where Launch Complex 1 is located. Among the payloads on the mission for Spaceflight were [[BlackSky]]’s Global-3 satellite and [[Melbourne Space Program]]’s ACRUX-1 CubeSat.
