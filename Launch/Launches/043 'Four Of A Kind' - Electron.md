>[!Success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
'Four Of A Kind', a dedicated mission for [[Spire Global]] Inc and its customer [[NorthStar Earth & Space]], was Rocket Lab's first Electron launch of 2024 and our 43rd Electron mission overall.
>
The mission launched on January 31st, 2024 at 19:34 NZDT (January 31st, 2024 06:34 UTC) from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. 'Four Of A Kind' deployed four Space Situational Awareness (SSA) satellites for [[Spire Global]], Inc’s (Spire) customer [[NorthStar Earth & Space]] (NorthStar). NorthStar´s satellites, built and operated by Spire, will be the first to simultaneously monitor all near-Earth orbits from space, delivering a radically enhanced level of SSA services to the global satellite community, with timely and precise information for space object detection, tracking, orbit determination, collision avoidance, navigation, and proximity alerts.
>
The mission also included the successful splashdown and recovery of Electron's first stage after the rocket stage returned to Earth from space.
