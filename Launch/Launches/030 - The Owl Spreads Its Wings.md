[[Launches]]  <span style="color: LightSlateGray">></span>  030 - The Owl Spreads Its Wings

>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
‚ÄúThe Owl Spreads Its Wings‚Äù mission launched from Rocket Lab[[ Launch Complex 1]] at 20:38 UTC on September 15, 2022.
>
The mission was the second of a bulk buy of three Electron launches by [[Synspective]] to deliver their [[Synspective#üõ∞Ô∏è Space Systems#StriX|StriX]] satellites to low Earth orbit. StriX-1 is [[Synspective]]‚Äôs first commercial satellite for its synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite constellation to deliver imagery that can detect millimeter-level changes to the Earth‚Äôs surface from space, independent of weather conditions on Earth and at any time of the day or night. ‚ÄúThe Owl Spreads Its Wings‚Äù was Rocket Lab‚Äôs third mission for Synspective after successful launches in December 2020 and February 2022.
>
The mission for Synspective marked a series of company milestones for Rocket Lab: its 30th Electron launch, its 300th Rutherford engine, and the single StriX-1 satellite manifested on this Electron launch brought Rocket Lab‚Äôs tally of satellites delivered to orbit to 150.
