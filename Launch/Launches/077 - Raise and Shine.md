>[!warning] Mission Pending

"RAISE And Shine" is the first of two dedicated Electron launches with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ([[JAXA]]).

"RAISE And Shine" will launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand during a launch window that opens December 5, UTC. This mission will deploy the Agency's Rapid Innovative payload demonstration SatellitE-4 (RAISE-4) spacecraft, a single satellite that will demonstrate eight technologies developed by private companies, universities, and research institutions throughout Japan.

The mission is Rocket Lab's first dedicated Electron launch directly contracted with JAXA, emphasizing Electron's importance to reliable global space access for both domestic and allied international space agencies.

>[!summary] Mission Context
On October 12, 2022, JAXA launched the Epsilon-6 rocket carrying RAISE-3 and several other small satellites. Approximately 7 minutes into the flight, a failure occurred in the second stage's Reaction Control System (RCS) ([News Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSPLGsMTXA8)), preventing the rocket from maintaining the correct attitude for orbit insertion. JAXA was forced to send a destruct command, resulting in the total loss of the [RAISE-3 satellite](https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/raise-3.htm) and all its experimental payloads.
>
The "Phoenix" Mission Rather than waiting years for the next [Epsilon vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_(rocket)) (the under-development Epsilon S), JAXA initiated a recovery plan to re-fly the lost experiments as quickly as possible. They authorized the "Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration-4" program to rebuild the satellite bus (now RAISE-4) and re-manufacture the lost payloads.
