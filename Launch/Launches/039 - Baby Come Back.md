>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
Rocket Lab's 39th [[Electron]] mission, called "Baby Come Back" will deploy seven satellites to space and include an attempt to recover the rocket's first stage after it splashes down in the ocean.
>
'Baby Come Back' will launch from [[Launch Complex 1#Launch Pad B (LC-1B)|Pad B]] at [[Launch Complex 1]] in Mahia, New Zealand.
>
The ‚ÄòBaby Come Back‚Äô mission is a rideshare mission and will carry satellites for multiple customers, including: 
>
[[NASA]]:  NASA‚Äôs [Starling mission](https://www.nasa.gov/smallspacecraft/what-is-starling/) is a four CubeSat mission designed to test technologies to enable future ‚Äúswarm‚Äù missions. Spacecraft swarms refer to multiple spacecraft autonomously coordinating their activities to achieve certain goals. Starling will demonstrate technologies for in-space network communications, onboard relative navigation between spacecraft, autonomous maneuver planning, and execution, and distributed spacecraft autonomy - an experiment for small spacecraft to autonomously react to observations, paving the way for future science missions.
>
>[[CesiumAstro]]: as a partner in the above mentioned Starling mission, providing [[CesiumAstro#üõ∞Ô∏è Space Systems#CommPack Cross-Link Communications Payload|CommPack Cross-Link Communications Payloads]] for each of the four cubesats. 
>
[[UTIAS Space Flight Laboratory]]:  Space Flight Laboratory (SFL) selected Rocket Lab to launch Telesat‚Äôs LEO 3 demonstration satellite that will provide continuity for customer and ecosystem vendor testing campaigns following the decommissioning of Telesat‚Äôs Phase 1 LEO satellite.
>
[[Spire Global]] Global:  Spire will launch two 3U satellites carrying Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) payloads to replenish its fully deployed constellation of more than 100 multipurpose satellites. Spire‚Äôs satellites observe the Earth in real time using radio frequency technology. The data acquired by Spire‚Äôs GNSS-RO payloads provide global weather intelligence that can be assimilated into weather models to improve the accuracy of forecasts. Spire is the largest producer of GNSS-RO weather data, collecting over 20,000 RO profiles a day.
