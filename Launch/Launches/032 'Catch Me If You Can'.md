>[!summary]
Launched from Pad B at Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 on New Zealand‚Äôs Mahia Peninsula, the ‚ÄúCatch Me If You Can‚Äù mission was Rocket Lab‚Äôs 32nd Electron launch overall and second recovery mission of 2022.
>
The mission deployed its 152nd satellite to orbit, the MATS science payload for the [[Swedish National Space Agency]]. 
>
The ‚ÄúCatch Me If You Can‚Äù mission also resulted in a successful ocean splashdown of the Electron rocket‚Äôs first stage. Rocket Lab had planned to attempt amid-air capture of Electron‚Äôs first stage with a helicopter if conditions allowed, however not all requirements were met to ensure a successful capture Due to a brief telemetry loss with Electron‚Äôs first stage during its atmospheric re-entry, the helicopter was moved out of the capture zone per standard safety procedure. The Electron first stage completed a safe splashdown and will be brought back to Rocket Lab‚Äôs production facility for inspection and analysis.
