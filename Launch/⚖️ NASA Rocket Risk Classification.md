>[!summary] Rocket Risk Classification
To classify rockets designed to launch robotics missions into Earth orbit and beyond, [[NASA]] uses three categories based on risk associated with the rocket. To certify a rocket into one of these three categories, NASA uses a set of requirements that examines various aspects of the rockets including management systems, flight experience, design and analysis, testing, and risk management strategies.
## Category 1
**High Risk** – New, common rocket configuration with little or no prior demonstrated flight history.

## Category 2
**Medium Risk** – Rockets that have a limited history of successful flights representing an 89% demonstrated reliability. 

## Category 3
**Low Risk** – Rockets that have a more robust flight history representing a 95% demonstrated reliability.
