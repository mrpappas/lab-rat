## Summary

Electron is a two-stage, partially reusable orbital launch vehicle developed by Rocket Lab. Electron services the commercial small satellite launch market. It's the third most launched small-lift launch vehicle in history. Its [[#Rutherford Engine]] engines are the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital-class rocket. Electron is often flown with a [[#Kick Stage]] or Rocket Lab's [[Photon]] spacecraft.

## Performance

Electron is designed to place payloads of up to 200 kg into a circular SSO at 500 km altitude, but can also accommodate a wide range of different payload and orbit requirements.

## Kick Stage

### Summary

Rocket Lab has also developed an optional third stage, known as the "kick stage", designed to circularize the orbits of its satellite payloads. The stage also puts satellites into a more accurate orbit in less time. The Electron kick stage is equipped with a single [[Curie]] engine that is capable of performing multiple burns, uses an unspecified "green" bipropellant, and is 3D printed. It was first used during Electron's second flight. The kick stage can transport up to 150 kg (330 lb) of payload.

Rocket Lab has also developed a derivative spacecraft of the kick stage, [[Photon]], which was originally intended for use on lunar and interplanetary missions. Photon has since evolved into four distinct variants for different mission profiles: [[Photon]], [[Pioneer]], [[Lightning]], and [[Explorer]].

- Deployment of payloads at multiple planes/inclinations
- Higher altitude deployment
- Hosted payload support
- Multiple trajectory changes
- Sustained low altitude orbits
- Deorbiting payloads to eliminate space debris

## Development 

- Electron was developed for only $100 million ($123 million inflation-adjusted), putting development costs on par with Falcon 1's $90 million ($131 million inflation-adjusted)
- Electron was developed in 2.8 years and is the fasted commercially developed rocket to reach 50 launches (7.1 years after first launch).
