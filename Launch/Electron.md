>[!summary]
Electron is a two-stage, partially reusable orbital launch vehicle developed by Rocket Lab. Electron services the commercial small satellite launch market. It's the third most launched small-lift launch vehicle in history. Its [[#Rutherford Engine]] engines are the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital-class rocket. Electron is often flown with a [[#Kick Stage]] or Rocket Lab's [[Photon]] spacecraft.

## Rutherford Engine

>[!summary]
Rutherford is a liquid-propellant rocket engine designed by Rocket Lab and manufactured in Long Beach, California. It uses LOX (liquid oxygen) and RP-1 (refined kerosene) as its propellants and is the first flight-ready engine to use the electric-pump-fed cycle. The rocket uses a similar engine arrangement to the Falcon 9; a two-stage rocket using a cluster of nine identical engines on the first stage, and one vacuum-optimized version with a longer nozzle on the second stage. This arrangement is also known as an octaweb. The sea-level version produces 24.9 kN (5,600 lbf) of thrust and has a specific impulse of 311 s (3.05 km/s), while the vacuum optimized-version produces 25.8 kN (5,800 lbf) of thrust and has a specific impulse of 343 s (3.36 km/s).

| Spec                                 | Value             |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Lift-off Thrust (sea level / vacuum) | 25 kN / 26 kN     |
| **Cycle**                            | Electric-pump-fed |
| **Thrust to Weight Ratio**           | 72.8              |
| **Dry Mass**                         | 35 kg             |
| Diameter                             | .25m / 9.8 in     |

The Rutherford engine’s production scalability is facilitated by additively manufactured, or 3D printed, primary components. With a 3D printed combustion chamber, injectors, pumps, and main propellant valves, Rutherford has the most 3D printed components of any rocket engine in the world. These primary components can be printed in 24 hours, drastically reducing production timelines compared with traditional production methods.

Rutherford engines are used as both first stage and second stage engines on the Electron launch vehicle, with nine engines on the first stage and a single vacuum optimized engine on the second stage. The sea level versions on Electron’s first stage produce 24 kN (5,500 lbf) of thrust each and with a specific impulse of 311 seconds, while the vacuum optimized version on Electron’s second stage produces a max thrust of 24 kN (5,500 lbf) of thrust and a specific impulse of 343 seconds.

Instead of being powered by traditional gas turbine pumps, Rutherford uses a cycle of brushless DC electric motors and high-performance lithium polymer batteries to drive its propellant pumps. This cuts down on much of the complex turbomachinery typically required for gas generator cycle engines, meaning that the Rutherford is simpler to build than a traditional engine but still can achieve 90% efficiency.

Rutherford engines are manufactured at Rocket Lab’s headquarters in Long Beach, California.

## Kick Stage

>[!summary]
Rocket Lab has also developed an optional third stage, known as the "kick stage", designed to circularize the orbits of its satellite payloads. The stage also puts satellites into a more accurate orbit in less time. The Electron kick stage is equipped with a single [[#Curie Engine]] engine that is capable of performing multiple burns, uses an unspecified "green" bipropellant, and is 3D printed. It was first used during Electron's second flight. The kick stage can transport up to 150 kg (330 lb) of payload.
>
>Rocket Lab has also developed a derivative spacecraft of the kick stage, [[Photon]], which is intended for use on lunar and interplanetary missions. Photon will be capable of delivering small payloads of up to 30 kg (66 lb) into lunar orbit.

- Deployment of payloads at multiple planes/inclinations
- Higher altitude deployment
- Hosted payload support
- Multiple trajectory changes
- Sustained low altitude orbits
- Deorbiting payloads to eliminate space debris
