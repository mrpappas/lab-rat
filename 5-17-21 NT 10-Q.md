## Notes

- **Vector Acquisition Corporation** filed this Form 12b-25 to notify the SEC of its inability to timely file its **Form 10-Q** for the quarter ended **March 31, 2021**.
- The delay is attributed to the company assessing the SEC's "Staff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by SPACs," which may necessitate classifying warrants as liabilities rather than equity.
- The company confirmed that there are no anticipated significant changes in results of operations from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
