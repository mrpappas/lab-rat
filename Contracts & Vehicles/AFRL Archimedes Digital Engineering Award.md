>[!summary] AFRL Archimedes Digital Engineering Award
**Date**: November 2024  
**Contract Value**: **$8 million** (up to)  
**Type**: Single‑award AFRL R&D contract under the **Rocket Propulsion Division (AFRL/RQR)**  
**Purpose**: Demonstrate **digital engineering (DE)** methods in the design of the Archimedes engine for the Neutron reusable rocket.
**Vehicle**: [[Neutron]]
>
> AFRL will collaborate with Rocket Lab to apply DE principles to the **oxidizer-rich staged combustion Archimedes engine**, reduce cost and schedule, and build a DE framework for future **NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 providers**

>[!quote] Peter Beck (CEO) on the award
>“This contract is a win-win when it comes to defense and industry partnerships. It not only allows the U.S. Air Force to collaborate with industry leaders like the Archimedes team to help modernize the U.S. Air Force’s engineering processes and capabilities, but it will also support smoother integration of Neutron to the NSSL program to more efficiently and quickly provide for some of the nation’s most critical missions. We’re looking forward to showcasing our novel technology solutions for the AFRL to help drive their digital engineering strategies to reality.”

## Objectives

✅ Implementation of DE tools to simulate and validate engine subsystems
✅ Development of a reusable propulsion design cycle powered by iterative modeling
✅ Establishment of engineering infrastructure for Neutron certification under NSSL  

## Context

- Positions Rocket Lab as an AFRL partner in digital-first engine development
- Enables faster, lower-risk design for Neutron’s propulsion systems
- Supports national security launch readiness via standardized architecture
