>[!summary] NSSL Phase 3
**Customer:** [[U.S. Space Force]]
Contract Value: $5.6 Billion
Type: IDIQ
Period: Through 2029
>
NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 is a service-based, firm-fixed-price IDIQ contract structure under the [[U.S. Space Force]] designed for low-to-medium risk national security space missions. It supports flexible, task-order-based acquisitions intended to encourage competition, innovation, and rapid integration of emerging commercial launch providers. Lane 1 is open to multiple vendors and targets missions such as rideshares, small-to-medium payloads, or those with less stringent timelines or assurance requirements. It runs in parallel with Lane 2, which is reserved for high-assurance, critical missions with more demanding technical and schedule needs.

>[!quote] Sir Peter Beck (CEO) on inclusion in NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1
>‚ÄúSupporting assured access to space for the nation‚Äôs most important missions has always been the goal with our Neutron rocket, and we‚Äôre incredibly proud to selected by the U.S. Space Force to demonstrate this commitment for the NSSL. Neutron is a powerful new launch option that will set a new standard for performance, affordability, and reliability in medium launch, and its selection to the program demonstrates a high degree of confidence by the Department of Defense in Neutron‚Äôs capabilities ahead of its first launch later this year. We can‚Äôt wait to showcase Neutron as the important platform it will become for the Department of Defense.‚Äù
