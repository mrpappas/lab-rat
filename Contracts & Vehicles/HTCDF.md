## Activity

### On-Ramp - 14 Apr 2025  

  Rocket Lab (via its **[[HASTE]]** suborbital platform) was accepted as an HTCDF supplier, allowing it to bid launch-service and engineering task orders under any of the framework’s lots. 

>[!quote] Sir Peter Beck (CEO) on joining HTCDF  
>“The ability to contribute toward the collective security of the United States and the United Kingdom across both of these important programs is a proud moment… Keeping pace with global developments means more affordable tests at a higher rate that expands the boundaries of hypersonic technology.”
