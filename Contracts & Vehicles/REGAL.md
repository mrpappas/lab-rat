## Activity

### CRADA with [[USTRANSCOM]]
6 Sep 2022

Rocket Lab signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with [[USTRANSCOM]] to explore using **[[Neutron]]**, **[[Electron]]**, and **[[Photon]]** to transport cargo globally.

- Investigated on-orbit **[[Photon]] depots** for cargo staging and re-entry
- Modeled logistics timelines, G-force constraints, and delivery architectures
- Supported early requirements development for the **Rocket Cargo Vanguard**

> *This CRADA was non-monetary, but paved the way for future flight demos under REGAL.*

### REGAL Call 002 Task Order: Neutron Return-to-Earth Demo
8 May 2025

Rocket Lab was awarded a task order under REGAL Call 002 to conduct a full **return-to-Earth Neutron mission** for cargo survivability testing.

- Launches a mass-representative payload aboard **Neutron**
- Performs controlled re-entry and landing with full cargo intact
- Evaluates TPS, dynamic loads, landing accuracy, and rapid offload

#### Estimated Contract Value: Unknown

- **$54.2M** earmarked in AFRL’s FY25 budget for 'Rocket Cargo' flight testing, this likely includes [SpaceX's 5 year, ~$100m task order](https://spacenews.com/spacex-wins-102-million-air-force-contract-to-demonstrate-technologies-for-point-to-point-space-transportation/)
- **$4M** supplement provided by the U.S. Space Force logistics office

## Context & Next Steps

- **Vanguard Roadmap** -> CRADA studies -> REGAL flight demos -> full operational capability under USSF
- **DoD Need** -> Deliver Patriot batteries, radar kits, or humanitarian supplies faster than airlift
- **Future Scale** -> 100 t delivery with Starship / similar, or 10-13 t modular drops with reusable Neutron
