>The VADR (Venture-Class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare) contract is a multi-award IDIQ established by NASA to procure low-cost, risk-tolerant launch services for small payloads, enabling rapid mission timelines and experimental technologies to reach orbit. Rocket Lab was one of several providers selected under VADR, positioning Electron as a key asset for NASAâ€™s smaller science and tech demonstration missions. Unlike traditional NASA launch services, VADR emphasizes commercial flexibility and streamlined acquisition, allowing Rocket Lab to support payloads that may not meet the stringent requirements of larger programs but are critical for early-stage innovation and responsive space access.
