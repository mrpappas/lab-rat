>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
The DARPA R3D2 mission was Rocket Lab’s fifth mission and the company’s first launch of 2019.
>
The mission launched the R3D2 (Radio Frequency Risk Reduction Deployment Demonstration) payload for DARPA. R3D2 was a prototype reflect array antenna designed to improve radio communications in small spacecraft.
>
The R3D2 antenna, made of a tissue-thin Kapton membrane, packed tightly inside a small satellite for stowage during launch, before deploying to its full size of 2.25 meters in diameter once it reached low Earth orbit. By compacting a large antenna into a small satellite, the spacecraft can provide significant capability, negating the need for satellite owners to build large satellites that can only be launched as a ride-share payload on big rockets with significant price tags and lengthy delays.
>
The 150kg R3D2 satellite lifted off on an Electron rocket from Launch Complex 1 on New Zealand’s Māhia Peninsula and was deployed to a 425kmx425km orbit at 39.5 degrees by Electron’s Kick Stage, a nimble upper stage designed to insert payloads with precise accuracy before deorbiting itself and leaving no space junk behind.
