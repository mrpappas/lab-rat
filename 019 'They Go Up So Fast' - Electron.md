>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
Rocket Lab's 19th Electron mission deployed a range of satellites for commercial and government satellite operators, as well as placed a next-generation Rocket Lab Photon spacecraft in orbit to build spacecraft heritage ahead of Rocket Lab‚Äôs mission to the Moon for [[./NASA|NASA]] later this year. 
>
 Seven satellites featured on the mission manifest, including:
>
>- An Earth-observation satellite for [[./BlackSky|BlackSky]] via launch services provider Spaceflight Inc.;
>- Two Internet-Of-Things (IoT) nanosatellites for companies [[./Fleet Space|Fleet Space]] and [[./Myriota|Myriota]], procured by [[./Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems|Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems]];
>- A technology demonstration satellite for the University of [[UNSW Canberra Space |New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra Space]];
>- a weather satellite pathfinder technology demonstration from [[./Care Weather|Care Weather]] technologies;
>- A technology demonstrator for the [[./U.S. Army|U.S. Army]]‚Äôs Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) through launch integration and program management services provider, [[./Trisept|TriSept]].
>
The final payload on this mission was Rocket Lab‚Äôs in-house designed and built Photon Pathstone. The spacecraft will operate on orbit as a risk reduction demonstration to build spacecraft heritage ahead of Rocket Lab‚Äôs mission to the Moon for NASA later this year, as well as Rocket Lab's private mission to Venus in 2023. Photon Pathstone will demonstrate power management, thermal control, and attitude control subsystems, as well as newly-integrated technologies including deep-space radio capability, an upgraded RCS (reaction control system) for precision pointing in space, and sun sensors and star trackers. Pathstone is the second Photon spacecraft to be deployed to orbit, following the launch of Photon First Light in August 2020.
