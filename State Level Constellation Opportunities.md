Rocket Lab could stand to benefit greatly from this but dealing with foreign govenments presents unique challenges

## 🌍 Foreign Governments vs. Foreign Commercial Clients

### Export Controls

- **🏛️ Foreign Governments:** Require U.S. State Dept. approval (e.g., ITAR export licenses, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), often in the form of a Technical Assistance Agreement (TAA) or a Manufacturing License Agreement (MLA), especially for military or dual-use payloads. Scrutiny is higher due to national security considerations.  
- **💰 Foreign Commercial Companies:** Generally easier to get approvals, especially for civil or scientific applications. Still subject to ITAR/EAR, but fewer hurdles.


### **ITAR, short for International Traffic in Arms Regulations**
a set of U.S. government regulations administered by the Department of State that controls the export and import of defense-related articles and services, aiming to safeguard national security and foreign policy objectives

### Procurement & Deal Structure

- **🏛️ Foreign Governments:**  
  - Slower procurement cycles  
  - Often require formal bidding processes, oversight, or sovereign approvals  
  - May include offsets or local participation requirements  
- **💰 Foreign Companies:**  
  - Faster decision-making  
  - Simpler contract structures  
  - More flexibility in timelines and specs  

### Deal Scale & Strategic Value

- **🏛️ Government contracts** tend to be larger, longer-term, and strategic in nature (e.g., multi-satellite constellations, national infrastructure).  
- **💰 Commercial contracts** are typically smaller, faster to close, and more repeatable.

## Foreign Governments Ranked by Plausibility

### ✅ **Tier 1: Very Likely

These countries are **trusted U.S. allies**, often part of **Five Eyes, NATO, or U.S. defense coalitions**.

| Country        | Why They're Likely                                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New Zealand    |                                                                                    |
| United States  | Core business. Major contracts with SDA, DoD, NASA.                                |
| United Kingdom | Existing commercial clients; strong defense and space investment.                  |
| Australia      | Deep Five Eyes partner, defense spending ramp-up, canceled LM satellite = opening. |
| Japan          | Civil and commercial clients already; aligned strategically.                       |
| Canada         | Strong space sector (e.g., MDA), Five Eyes partner.                                |
| Germany        | Civil clients, ESA member, active in space investment.                             |
| Spain          | Host to launch infrastructure (e.g., possible UK launch corridor partners).        |
| South Korea    | Space investment boom, U.S.-aligned, looking for military space growth.            |
|                |                                                                                    |
|                |                                                                                    |

### 🟡 **Tier 2: Plausible / Needs Some Policy Maneuvering**
These are **U.S.-friendly or neutral** countries that might need **licensing or careful structuring**, but are *absolutely* possible for commercial or civil contracts.

| Country   | Why It's Plausible                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| France    | Key ESA member, has its own launch sector but possible payload partner.                                                               |
| Israel    | U.S. ally with advanced space/military tech. Needs export clearance but plausible.                                                    |
| Singapore | Small but tech-heavy. Could contract for observation or telecom missions.                                                             |
| Sweden    | ESA member, growing defense activity; likely payload customer.                                                                        |
| Norway    | Strong Arctic observation interest; U.S.-aligned.                                                                                     |
| Belgium   | Works closely with ESA and NATO; could be a component or integration customer.                                                        |
| India     | Tricky. Technically feasible but ITAR hurdles + ISRO’s own domestic capacity make this rare unless it's through private Indian firms. |
| UAE       | Aggressive space growth (Mars mission, Moon ambitions), politically touchy, but plausible.                                            |

### 🟠 **Tier 3: Long Shot / High Hurdles**
Would require **serious export control navigation**, strong political will, or some kind of joint venture with U.S. approval. Not impossible, but not something RL could just announce tomorrow.

| Country      | Why It’s Tricky                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Saudi Arabia | U.S. arms sales still occur, but ITAR export of space/military tech is sensitive. Possible for civilian payloads with approval. |
| Qatar        | Politically neutral enough, but not a space leader. Limited upside.                                                             |
| Turkey       | NATO member but politically volatile. U.S. export licenses harder to secure.                                                    |
| Brazil       | Has a launch site and a modest space program. Civil partnerships possible.                                                      |
| Indonesia    | Regional interest in space. Some infrastructure, but early stage.                                                               |
| South Africa | Civil partnerships possible, but limited budget and ITAR obstacles.                                                             |

### ❌ **Tier 4: No-Go (Due to ITAR or Geopolitical Alignment)**
These countries are **off-limits or extremely unlikely** unless significant U.S. policy shifts occur.

| Country     | Why Not                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| China       | Blanket ITAR prohibition. Zero chance.                          |
| Russia      | Sanctions and geopolitical hostility. Completely off the table. |
| Iran        | U.S. embargo. Illegal under ITAR.                               |
| North Korea | No explanation needed.                                          |




## Australia

**2025 Military Budget**: ~$35 Billion

Stated goal of AU$100 billion defense spending by 2033-2034

As of 2024 the TSA (Technology Safeguards Agreement) between US and Australia is active. This is a treaty-level agreement required by the US to allow American companies, government organizations and universities to undertake space launch activities in Australia. That includes: US launch vehicles, including spacecraft and satellites as well as US equipment and data associated with space launch activities.
### Defense Joint Project 9102

Cancelled in November 2024, JP9102 was launched in 2021 with plans to develop between three to five geostationary satellites and ground systems.  An estimated **$5 billion project** awarded to [[Lockheed Martin]] to develop and deliver the satellites / capabilities. 

The project was cancelled due to the industry moving away single orbit constellations

>“With the acceleration in space technologies and evolving threats in space since the project’s commencement, Defense has assessed that a single orbit GEO-based satellite communications system would not meet strategic priorities”

The Australian Defense Magazine states that Australia will instead prioritize "a multi-orbit capability," which would increase its resilience. That seems to suggest moving away from large but vulnerable satellites to smaller and more numerous ones. The publication notes that this mirrors moves in the US, which has also been moving away from single-orbit constellations over fears about their vulnerability.

## Japan

**2025 Military Budget**: ~$58 Billion
**Defense Budget Earmarked for Space**: >$1 Billion
**National Space Agency:** JAXA 
**JAXA Budget**: ~ $1.4 Billion

### Japan-US Space Pact

Known as the “Framework Agreement Between the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America for Cooperation in Space Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, For Peaceful Purposes,” this pact recognizes a mutual interest in peaceful exploration.

### Space Strategy Fund

In March 12, 2024 Announced Space Strategy Fund - $6.7 Billion 10-year fund for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in November, aimed at supporting development, technology demonstration, and commercialization of advanced technologies in the space field. 

"A supplementary budget for the Financial Year 2025 allocates 300 billion yen ($2 billion) to support space technology development. This includes contributions from various ministries, emphasizing a collaborative approach to advancing Japan’s space capabilities."

In comparison the SDA's 2025 request 2025 budget is 4.27 B, with plans to spend > $25 Billion building out LEO capabilities by the end of the decade.
