### Kin√©is IoT

The Kin√©is IoT satellites are a constellation of advanced nanosatellites designed to provide seamless global connectivity for [[üì¶ Payload Types#Internet of Things (IoT)|Internet of Things (IoT)]] devices. Each satellite, weighing approximately 30 kg, operates in low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of around 650 km, enabling low-latency and cost-efficient communication. Leveraging UHF (401-406 MHz) and AIS frequencies, these satellites support two-way communication for IoT applications and real-time maritime tracking. With an expected operational life of 7 years, the Kin√©is constellation integrates deployable antennas, high-capacity batteries, and robust onboard systems to ensure reliable data collection and transmission in diverse environments. Applications span environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, logistics, smart cities, and maritime safety, making Kin√©is a cornerstone for scalable and efficient satellite-based IoT solutions.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Notes

KineÃÅis currently operates the [Argos System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argos_(satellite_system)), an international scientific collaboration between [[CNES]], the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), to monitor wildlife, fisheries, and to collect data about Earth‚Äôs climate and environment through CLS. KineÃÅis‚Äô new constellation will complete the current system with more powerful 30kg-class nanosats that integrate IoT technology and a ship-tracking Automatic Identification System (AIS). Once deployed, this technology will allow KineÃÅis to expand across multiple industries and scale from 20,000 devices connected to millions.
