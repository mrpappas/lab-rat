### Mandrake-2

DARPA's Mandrake 2 is a technology demonstration program designed to test and validate advanced optical inter-satellite communication links. Part of DARPA‚Äôs [Blackjack program](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/blackjack), it aims to develop and deploy small satellite constellations with robust, low-latency, and high-bandwidth data transfer capabilities.

Mandrake 2 consists of two small satellites equipped with optical communication terminals, enabling high-speed data transfers in low Earth orbit (LEO). The program tests autonomous acquisition and tracking between satellites, a critical step for enabling resilient, laser-based communication networks in space.

### R3D2

https://www.darpa.mil/news/2019/reflectarray-antenna-prototype
DARPA‚Äôs R3D2 (Radio Frequency Risk Reduction Deployment Demonstration) spacecraft intends to space-qualify a prototype reflect array antenna to improve radio communications in small spacecraft. The 150kg spacecraft carried an antenna, made of a tissue-thin Kapton membrane, designed to pack tightly inside the small satellite for stowage during launch, before deploying to its full size of 2.25 meters in diameter in low Earth orbit. The design is intended to provide significant capability, typical of large spacecraft, in a much smaller package. The mission could lay the groundwork for a space-based internet by helping to validate emerging concepts for a resilient sensor and data transport layer in low Earth orbit ‚Äì a capability that does not exist today.
