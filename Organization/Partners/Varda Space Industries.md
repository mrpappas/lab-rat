>[!summary]
Varda Space Industries is pioneering in-space manufacturing by leveraging microgravity to produce materials and products that are superior to those made on Earth. By building and deploying space-based factories, Varda creates high-value products‚Äîlike advanced pharmaceuticals and specialized materials‚Äîthat benefit from the unique conditions of space. These products are then safely returned to Earth, enabling breakthrough innovations in medicine, technology, and industrial manufacturing.

### W-Series
Varda‚Äôs W-Series capsule is an autonomous free-flying microgravity formulation platform intended for in-orbit pharmaceutical manufacturing followed by terrestrial landing. The W-Series capsule reenters the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere at more than 18,000 miles per hour and reaches speeds above Mach 25.  The capsule touches down on land via a parachute. The W-Series capsules‚Äô heatshields are made of[ C-PICA (Conformal Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator)](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20220019340/downloads/SMDshowCase_CPICA_Poster.pdf), a thermal protection material produced by [[NASA]] Ames Research Center. The material was originally developed at Ames, and the reentry of W-1 marked the first time a NASA-manufactured C-PICA heat shield ever returned from space.

The W-Series is built on Rocket Lab's [[Pioneer]] platform, but Varda has indicated their intentions to bring manufacturing of the W-Series in house.
