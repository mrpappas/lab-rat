>[!summary]
>Hypersonix Engineering is an Australian aerospace company specializing in hypersonic technology. It develops reusable scramjet engines and high-speed flight systems for commercial and defense applications. Its flagship technology, the Spartan scramjet engine, is hydrogen-powered and designed for sustained hypersonic flight (Mach 5+). The company focuses on satellite launch systems, hypersonic drones, and reusable space access solutions.

>[!info] Upcoming Mission
>Hypersonix has a launch services contract with Rocket Lab through the Department of Defense's Innovation Unit for a [[HASTE]] mission out of [[Launch Complex 2]].  The launch was originally expected to be in Q1 2025 but has likely been pushed to later in the year per a company [Linkedin Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hypersonixau_dart-hypersonics-scramjets-activity-7299589828147298304-shQN/):

### DART AE

https://www.hypersonix.com/technology/dart

DART AE is a 3m-long, single-use, multi-mission hypersonic system that is entirely 3D-printed out of high-temperature alloys. It is meant for the development, demonstration, testing and evaluation of hypersonic technologies, in addition to other potential hypersonic applications.

The 300kg hypersonic system can travel up to a range of 1,000km at a speed of Mach 7. It can be launched via an unguided [sounding rocket](https://www.nasa.gov/soundingrockets/), which will lower expenses and enhance the versatility of both the launch and mission possibilities. It can also be launched from a guided rocket, as well as air-launched.

The demonstrator has been developed to enable customers to explore flight conditions, data transmission, and maneuverability at hypersonic speeds. It will have the capacity to acquire valuable information and understanding regarding hypersonic operations at a significantly more budget-friendly cost compared to currently available hypersonic systems.  Given that it is a simple design with few moving parts, uses hydrogen as fuel and is air-breathing, its operational and environmental characteristics are desirable.

### SPARTAN

https://www.hypersonix.com/technology/spartan

SPARTAN stands for Scramjet Powered Accelerator for Reusable Technology Advancement. It is a fifth-generation, reusable hydrogen-powered scramjet engine developed by Hypersonix.

In addition to emitting zero carbon dioxide, clean-burning hydrogen fuel enables the engine to be turned on and off multiple times during a flight. The capability allows for a non-ballistic trajectory that conventional rockets cannot achieve. Together with the control surfaces integrated into its DART AE fuselage, this gives DART AE unique maneuverability at high speeds. The use of Hydrogen fuel offers a greater range compared to other scramjets.
