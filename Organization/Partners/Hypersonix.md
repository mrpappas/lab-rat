>[!summary]
>Hypersonix Launch Systems is an Australian space startup developing scramjet and scramjet-based access-to-space technology. In particular, the company is focused on reusable "green-fuelled" launch technology. The company specializes in hypersonic vehicle and scramjet engines to provide sustainable and affordable access to space.

>[!info] Upcoming Mission
>Hypersonix has a launch services contract with Rocket Lab through the Department of Defense's Innovation Unit for a [[HASTE]] mission out of [[Launch Complex 2]].  The launch was originally expected to be in Q1 2025 but has likely been pushed to later in the year per a company [Linkedin Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hypersonixau_dart-hypersonics-scramjets-activity-7299589828147298304-shQN/):

## üõ∞Ô∏è Space Systems

### Dart

DART is a three-meter-long, single-use, high-temperature alloy, hydrogen-fueled, [scramjet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet) technology demonstrator. 

- Entirely 3D printed airframe made of high temperature alloys
- Designed and manufactured in Australia
- Leverages the Hydrogen fuel capabilities of [[#SPARTAN]] for its high thrust and environmental benefits
- Can be launched using both unguided [sounding rockets](https://www.nasa.gov/soundingrockets/) and guided rockets like [[HASTE]]
- Simple in design allowing rapid production, uses commercially available flight proven components to maximize scalability

| Specification | Value   |
| ------------- | ------- |
| Length        | 3m      |
| Mass          | 300 kg  |
| Range         | 1000 km |
| Max Speed     | Mach 7  |

### SPARTAN

SPARTAN is a 3D-printed scramjet engine, delivering performance, reliability, lead time and cost advantages over more bespoke manufacturing methods.

- **Air-breathing engine** - The simple, robust and reusable air-breathing engine system is the result of 30 years‚Äô research, more than 6,000 ground firings, and 11 sub-orbital flights through the [HIFiRE](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/partnership/hifire-program) and [HyShot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyShot) programs.
- **3D printed high temperature alloys** - Hypersonix 3D printed the world‚Äôs first fixed geometry scramjet engine in 2021. The maximum speed that can be achieved is depending on materials used.
- **Reusable and fuel-efficient** - Both reusable and self-igniting, SPARTAN has no moving parts and uses hydrogen fuel to minimize environmental impact as it has no CO2 emissions.
- **Water vapor exhaust** - Unlike other launch systems on the market, the SPARTAN scramjet produces only H2O exhaust and can leverage the sustainable benefits of green hydrogen fuel.
- **Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC)** - SPARTAN is made from CMCs as they are lightweight, with a high strength-to-weight ratio (even at high temperatures), high thermal shock resistance and toughness.
- **Powered by hydrogen** - Hypersonix‚Äôs SPARTAN scramjet uses hydrogen as fuel for its high thrust and longer flight times.
