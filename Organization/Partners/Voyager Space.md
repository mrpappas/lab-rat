### Valley Tech Systems

#### Summary 
**Founded**: 2007
**Acquired**: October 4 2021 - [Article](https://voyagertechnologies.com/press-releases/voyager-space-announces-acquisition-of-valley-tech-systems/)

[USASpending.gov Prime Awards](https://www.usaspending.gov/search?hash=ee041857c55ad33ff378a3e63fb4b8c1)

**Description**: VTS was founded in 2007 and is known for pioneering technologies such as open architecture airborne ISR and controllable solid hypersonic propulsion. The company is focused on redefining technology to provide the highest standard of safety and affordability as applied to maneuvering reentry systems, missile defense, commercial and DoD space launch systems, small launch vehicles, and payloads. VTS also holds multiple awards from the Missile Defense Agency, NASA, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Army for its technologies that include reaction control systems, next-generation propulsion, active thruster nozzles, and more.

#### Propulsion Systems

##### Affordable Solid Post Boost Propulsion System 
The ASPBPS utilizes a solid gas generator and a manifold of proportional valves to deliver continuous, throttleable thrust (0–100%) for precise missile steering and orientation. By routing hot gas through variable-flow valves rather than relying on the fixed burn of traditional solid motors, the system achieves the fine-tuned agility of complex liquid-fuel architectures while maintaining the safety, stability, and lower lifecycle costs of solid propellant.

##### Fluid Transfer Coupling
Altius has developed a family of cryogenic capable fluid transfer couplings, which can serve as a ground T-0 quick disconnect umbilical, while also simplifying robotic on-orbit refueling, allowing it to become the standard interface for future in-space propellant transfer.
![[Pasted image 20251213025152.jpg|300]]
##### In Space Assembly
Altius’ ESCHER interface provides a universal interface for autonomous in-space or lunar surface assembly. Acting as both a structural interconnect and a grapple interface, it enables robotic systems to pick, place, and latch modular pieces of structure with the click of a button. The lightweight, dust tolerant, design uses EPM latching technology to ensure high reliability and removes the need for complex robotic manipulation or tool changing during the assembly process.
