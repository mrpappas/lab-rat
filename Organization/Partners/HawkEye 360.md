## üõ∞Ô∏è Space Systems

### Hawk Satellite

Each HawkEye microsatellite carries two instruments, a software defined radio (SDR) and an RF front-end module. SDR consists of two components, an embedded processor, and three baseband signal processors. The onboard instruments process radio signals from various sources, enabling HawkEye 360 to detect and analyze RF signals across different frequencies. These instruments capture, filter, and convert the signals into usable data. The system allows for monitoring multiple frequencies at once, covering a wide range of applications.

Customers are primarily paying for the ability to track and analyze RF signals, which can be used for applications such as monitoring maritime activity, managing spectrum usage, and detecting illegal transmissions. This data provides valuable insights for government agencies, telecommunications, and defense sectors.
