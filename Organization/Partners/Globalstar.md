### Globalstar M104 - 120 (Globalstar-3)

The Globalstar global mobile communications network offers global, digital real time voice, data and fax via a constellation minisatellites. The constellation operates in a 1410 km orbit inclined at 52 degrees.  In early 2022, Globalstar contracted with MDA for the construction of 17 new satellites to replenish the existing constellation. There are also nine options for additional satellites. MDA partnered with Rocket Lab, who will build the satellite busses and launch dispensers.
