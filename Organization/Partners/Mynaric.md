>[!summary]
>Mynaric AG is a German company that develops and manufactures free-space optical (FSO) communication terminals for space, airborne, and terrestrial applications. The company specializes in laser communication technology designed to enable high-bandwidth, secure, and interference-free data transfer between satellites, aircraft, drones, and ground stations.
>
>Mynaric's products are primarily targeted at government and commercial customers deploying large-scale communication networks in space and the stratosphere. Their optical terminals are designed for high-rate inter-satellite links (ISLs) and air-to-ground connectivity, supporting applications such as proliferated low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations, defense-related tactical data networks, and high-altitude platform station (HAPS) connectivity.


## üåç Missions

### [[SDA Tranche 2 - Enhanced Global Coverage]]

In 2023, Rocket Lab selected Mynaric to supply optical communication terminals for the Space Development Agency‚Äôs (SDA) Tranche 2 Transport Layer - Beta Program, reinforcing its role as a critical supplier in the growing U.S. government and commercial space optical communications market.
