>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a U.S. government agency focused on understanding and managing the Earthâ€™s oceans, atmosphere, and related ecosystems. Established in 1970, NOAA plays a critical role in weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and environmental conservation. Key initiatives include operating the National Weather Service (NWS), managing a fleet of weather and environmental satellites, and conducting research through organizations like the National Ocean Service and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. NOAA supports disaster preparedness, marine resource management, and climate science, working with international and domestic partners to address challenges such as climate change, ocean health, and severe weather. Its efforts provide essential data for public safety, environmental stewardship, and economic development.
