>[!summary]
Advanced Space is a Colorado-based company specializing in mission design, navigation, and operations for space exploration, with a focus on cislunar and deep space missions. Known for their expertise in orbital dynamics and spacecraft navigation, Advanced Space supports commercial and government clients, including NASA. They are notably the operator of the CAPSTONE mission (Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment), a pathfinding CubeSat mission to the Moon that demonstrates navigation technology for the Gateway program in NASA's Artemis initiative. The company aims to advance the use of innovative technologies for sustainable space exploration.

### CAPSTONE
#### Summary
CAPSTONE (Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment) is a lunar orbiter that is testing and verifying the calculated orbital stability planned for the Lunar Gateway space station. The spacecraft is a 12-unit CubeSat that is also testing a navigation system that is measuring its position relative to [NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lro/) without relying on ground stations. It was [[027 - CAPSTONE|launched on 28 June 2022]], arrived in lunar orbit on 14 November 2022, and was scheduled to orbit for six months. On 18 May 2023, it completed its primary mission to orbit in the near-rectilinear halo orbit for six months, but will stay on this orbit, continuing to perform experiments during an enhanced mission phase.

#### CAPS (Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System)

üì° The **Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System (CAPS)** is a peer-to-peer navigation technology, incorporating relative tracking data between two or more vehicles. This improves existing navigation products, reduces the need for ground-based tracking expenses, and even permits autonomous, absolute navigation of all vehicles involved. 

üíª The CAPS navigation software is hosted on a separate flight computer from the spacecraft‚Äôs primary redundant flight computer boards and operate distinctly from one another. Being hosted on a separate board allows for the CAPS software to experience updates and modifications throughout the demonstration as observations are returned, without disrupting the operations of the primary flight computer(s).

 üõ∞Ô∏è CAPS is a unique innovation that operationalizes, and leverages investments made in algorithms, flight computers, and radios over the past decade. At its foundation, CAPS starts with the algorithms and logic of automated navigation layered on top of an innovative approach to absolute orbit determination that requires only relative radiometric ranging and Doppler measurements. In its most streamlined implementation, CAPS will be a software innovation that can be incorporated on any future spacecraft.
