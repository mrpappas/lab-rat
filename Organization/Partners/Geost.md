## Summary

Geost (now part of Rocket Lab’s Optical Systems portfolio) is a U.S. developer of space-qualified electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) payloads used for missile warning/tracking, space domain awareness (SDA), and ISR missions. Rocket Lab markets Geost-derived payload families such as Heimdall (SDA), Phoenix (EO/ISR), and Starlite (IR) as modular sensing options for national security space architectures. Geost’s earlier product line included Mercury for missile warning/tracking; the technology and heritage behind these sensors has been selected for SDA Tracking Layer work (e.g., via Sierra Space for Tranche 2). Rocket Lab completed its acquisition of Geost on August 12, 2025, adding in-house EO/IR payload capability alongside launch and spacecraft manufacturing to support vertically integrated national security missions.
