Example use cases include:

- detecting anomalies in road, rail, energy and other infrastructure, resulting in lower maintenance costs and accident risk,
- monitoring crop growth conditions and analyzing soil and vegetation health to help reduce costs and increase efficiency for farmers,
- detecting illegal logging and fishing in the most remote parts of the world,
- providing rapid damage assessment after flooding, landslides and volcanic eruptions, as well as risk assessment for land subsidence,
- enabling the persistent monitoring of maritime traffic, border activities and other potential security threats, and advances maritime domain awareness,
- analyzing tree cover to calculate CO2 absorption and carbon credits.
