>[!summary]
MDA Space is a Canadian-based company specializing in advanced space-based solutions. Founded in 1969, MDA has expertise in satellite systems, robotics, and Earth observation. Known for pioneering technologies like the [Canadarm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadarm) robotic systems for the International Space Station and the upcoming Lunar Gateway, MDA plays a vital role in global space exploration. Their geospatial data and analytics, derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites like the RADARSAT series, support defense, government, and commercial customers. In 2017, MDA became part of Maxar Technologies after acquiring DigitalGlobe, but in 2020, it re-established itself as an independent company following the sale of its Canadian assets. Today, MDA provides spacecraft manufacturing, satellite payloads, and mission-critical technologies, continuing its leadership in satellite communications, Earth observation, and robotics for space exploration.
