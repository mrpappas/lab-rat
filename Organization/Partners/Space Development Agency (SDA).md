>[!summary]
>The Space Development Agency (SDA), established on March 12, 2019, operates as a direct-reporting unit within the [[U.S. Space Force]], focusing on deploying disruptive space technologies to enhance national security. Its primary mission is to create and sustain lethal, resilient, threat-driven, and affordable military space capabilities that provide persistent, resilient, global, low-latency surveillance to deter or defeat adversaries. A key initiative is the development of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA), formerly known as the National Defense Space Architecture, which consists of a layered network of satellites in low Earth orbit designed to provide global coverage, resilience, and responsiveness for military operations. The SDA has plans to deploy at least 1,000 satellites by 2026. The agency emphasizes speed and agility in its operations, aiming to deliver capabilities to joint warfighting forces in two-year tranches, recognizing that timely deployment of "good enough" capabilities can be more beneficial than delayed perfection. In October 2022, the SDA transitioned to the management of the [[U.S. Space Force]], further integrating its efforts within the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]'s space operations.
