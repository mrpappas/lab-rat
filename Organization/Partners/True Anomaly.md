>[!summary]
>True Anomaly is a U.S. defense-focused space startup founded in 2022 by former U.S. military officers. The company develops spacecraft, autonomy software, and training environments to support space domain awareness (SDA), rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO), and related national security missions. Their flagship spacecraft, the Jackal autonomous orbital vehicle, is a modular bus designed for maneuverability, rapid tasking, and payload flexibility across LEO, GEO, and cislunar regimes. True Anomaly also develops the Mosaic autonomy stack and a digital training/simulation ecosystem, positioning itself as both a hardware and software provider for responsive space operations.

## Space Systems

### Jackal

#### Summary 

Jackal is a modular, maneuverable autonomous orbital vehicle (AOV) designed for multi-mission flexibility. Jackal’s multi-modal sensor suite and propulsion allow it to execute responsive maneuvers and act as a stand-in for both friendly and potentially non-cooperative spacecraft. With ~275 kg wet mass and a payload-agnostic design, it demonstrates how a rapid-response SDA/RPO platform can be 
deployed and tasked on short notice.
