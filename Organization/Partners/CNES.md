The Centre National d'√âtudes Spatiales (CNES) is France's national space agency, founded in 1961 to develop and execute the country‚Äôs space policy. It focuses on space exploration, Earth observation, telecommunications, defense, and technological innovation. CNES plays a significant role in studying planets, monitoring the environment, advancing satellite-based communication, and supporting national security through military satellite systems. It is a key partner in international collaborations with agencies like ESA, NASA, and others, contributing to joint missions and groundbreaking research. Among its notable achievements are its work on the Ariane rocket family, Earth observation programs such as Pleiades and Copernicus, and its involvement in Mars exploration missions and the James Webb Space Telescope. As a cornerstone of Europe‚Äôs space sector, CNES drives scientific discovery and technological progress on a global scale.

Argos-4 is a satellite payload that supports the [Argos Data Collection System](https://www.argos-system.org/), an international environmental monitoring program led by France‚Äôs CNES in collaboration with [[NOAA]] and [[EUMETSAT]]. It collects and relays data from a variety of sensors deployed globally, including wildlife trackers, ocean buoys, and weather stations, to support environmental monitoring, climate studies, and resource management. Launched on October 7, 2022, aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket, Argos-4 operates in a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of approximately 750 km with an inclination of about 98 degrees. Its mission is to enable continuous, low-data-rate transmissions from remote platforms to ground stations, enhancing global environmental data collection and analysis.
