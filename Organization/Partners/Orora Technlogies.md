>[!summary]
>Orora Technologies, more commonly known as OroraTech, is a German company focused on developing a constellation of small satellites equipped with thermal infrared cameras to detect wildfires early and provide real-time monitoring for faster response, essentially creating a global wildfire warning system using space-based technology; their primary product is called the "Wildfire Solution."

>Orora currently uses Spire Global's [[Spire Global#Space Systems#Lemur-2|Lemur-2]] CubeSat platform as the basis for their satellites and in parallel they are working directly with [[ESA]] to develop their own satellite bus and complete solution

### OTC-P1

**OTC-P1 (OroraTech Constellation Phase 1)** is a wildfire detection constellation. The satellites are based on a modified version of[ Spire Global's Lemur platform](https://spire.com/space-services/lemur-space-platform/) (8U variant). Each one carrying OroraTech‚Äôs [SAFIRE GEN 2](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/documents/20142/4139742/2.07_VH-RODA%202022%20-%20Thermal-IR%20Wildfire%20detection%20-%20DRFernandes.pdf), a unique and proprietary thermal-infrared camera (developed in partnership with [Kampf Telescope Optics](https://www.ktoptics.de/)) and a data processing unit designed to detect fires and transmit the data using [[Spire Global]]‚Äôs satellite and ground network. The technology will help identify and monitor the areas at risk of wildfires and enable early detection of wildfire hotspots.
