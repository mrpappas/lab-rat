>[!summary]
>Orora Technologies, more commonly known as OroraTech, is a German company focused on developing a constellation of small satellites equipped with thermal infrared cameras to detect wildfires early and provide real-time monitoring for faster response, essentially creating a global wildfire warning system using space-based technology; their primary product is called the "Wildfire Solution."

>Orora currently uses Spire Global's [[Spire Global#Space Systems#Lemur-2|Lemur-2]] CubeSat platform as the basis for their satellites and in parallel they are working directly with [[ESA]] to develop their own satellite bus and complete solution

### SAFIRE Gen 2

SAFIRE Gen 2 satellites are based on an enlarged 6U CubeSat version of [[Spire Global]]'s [[Spire Global#Space Systems#Lemur-2|Lemur-2]] cubesat and feature customized experiments additionally to the standard Lemur payload.
They carries OroraTech‚Äôs unique and proprietary thermal-infrared camera (developed in partnership with [Kampf Telescope Optics](https://www.ktoptics.de/))and data processing unit designed to detect fires and transmit the data using [[Spire Global]]‚Äôs satellite and ground network. The technology will help identify and monitor the areas at risk of wildfires and enable early detection of wildfire hotspots.
