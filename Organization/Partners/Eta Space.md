>[!summary]
>Eta Space is a U.S.-based company specializing in cryogenic fluid management technologies for space applications. Founded in 2019, the company focuses on the storage, transfer, and utilization of cryogenic propellants such as liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH2), which are critical for rocket propulsion and in-space operations. Eta Space develops innovative systems for long-duration cryogenic storage in microgravity, addressing challenges like boil-off and efficient thermal insulation.
>
One of Eta Space's flagship projects is the LOXSAT-1, a demonstration mission supported by NASA, aimed at advancing cryogenic fluid management in orbit. Their technologies have the potential to enable key advancements in space exploration, including reusable spacecraft, lunar and Martian surface operations, and in-orbit refueling depots. By advancing these capabilities, Eta Space contributes to the broader goal of sustainable and cost-effective space exploration and commercialization.
