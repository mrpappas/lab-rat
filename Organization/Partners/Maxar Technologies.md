Maxar Technologies Inc. is an American space technology company headquartered in Westminster, Colorado, United States, specializing in manufacturing communication, Earth observation, radar, and on-orbit servicing satellites, satellite products, and related services. In 2017, Maxar Technologies was formed following [[MDA]]'s acquisition of DigitalGlobe, integrating subsidiaries like Space Systems Loral and Radiant Solutions to focus on satellite manufacturing and geospatial analytics. In 2023, private equity firm [Advent International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_International) acquired Maxar for $6.4 billion, transitioning it to private ownership. Maxar subsequently reorganized into two divisions: Maxar Space Infrastructure, based in California, specializing in satellite manufacturing, and Maxar Intelligence, based in Colorado, focusing on geospatial data and analytics.
