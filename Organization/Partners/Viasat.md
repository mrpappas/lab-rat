## Space Systems

### Echo

Echo is a technology demonstrator spacecraft, built on Rocket Lab's [[Pioneer]] bus, intended to showcase real-time, multi-band space relay services under [NASA’s Communications Services Project (CSP)](https://www.nasa.gov/communicating-with-missions/communications-services-project/). Designed to support future LEO missions, Echo integrates Viasat’s Ka-band Real-Time Space Relay (RTSR) terminal and InCommand L-band TT&C system, enabling low-latency data transfer via GEO and direct-to-ground links. The spacecraft will validate Viasat’s Integrated Space Access Network (ISAN) for flexible, application-driven routing, and serves as a key step in replacing NASA’s legacy TDRSS architecture. Launch is scheduled for early 2026.
