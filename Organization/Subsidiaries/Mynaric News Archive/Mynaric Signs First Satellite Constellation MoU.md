- Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with satellite constellation builder
- First satellite launches planned for late 2019 as part of demonstration mission
- Demonstration mission paves the way for large scale deployment of Mynaric’s products

**Munich, 24 October 2018** – Mynaric can announce today that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with an undisclosed company building a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation.

Information that can be made public includes the planned first launch of several satellites equipped with Mynaric’s laser communication products in late 2019. The satellites will be part of a demonstration mission prior to rolling out the full constellation of an eventual several hundred satellites. The full constellation is expected to require upwards of 1,000 laser communication terminals. Mynaric is in close collaboration and holding intensive technical discussions with the satellite manufacturer at this moment.

> “The announcement we are making today firmly establishes Mynaric as a key supplier for the emerging LEO constellations market. To be trusted by a satellite constellation builder to work on a key component of their constellation affirms our business strategy to cater for the LEO market as well as the airborne and ground segments. We are well on track to becoming the go-to supplier for laser communications for the entire aerospace industry.”  
> Dr Markus Knapek, founder and board member of Mynaric

**About Mynaric  
**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to establish dynamic communication networks in air and space. Its wireless laser data transmission products include ground stations and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances between aircraft, autonomous drones, high altitude platforms, satellites and the ground at high data rates.

Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its wireless laser communication products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
