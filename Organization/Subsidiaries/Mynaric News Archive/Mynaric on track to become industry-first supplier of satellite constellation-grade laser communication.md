- Assembly of CONDOR space terminals for high bandwidth inter-satellite links has begun
- First customer commitments for CONDOR product already received by Mynaric as previously announced
- Number of units in production schedule unheard of in the history of aerospace laser communication industry

**Munich, April 3, 2020 –** Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11) can report today that despite the global coronavirus pandemic it remains on track to become the first vendor capable of delivering laser communication equipment suited for mega-constellations.

The company’s flagship CONDOR laser terminal is now for the first time being assembled at Mynaric’s production facilities in southern Germany with initial units earmarked for an extensive qualification campaign in the coming months, enabled by Mynaric’s investment in state-of-the-art equipment emulating the extreme rocket launch environments as well as the space environment and operational parameters of their expected life in low Earth orbit. Mynaric plans to produce more than a dozen CONDOR terminals this year with first units scheduled to be delivered into customer hands in H2 2020, well before any other competing product.

The CONDOR is a historic step forward for laser communication – a technology which has traditionally been the domain of one-off and scientific missions in the past – as it provides laser communication capabilities at a price point and broad availability needed for inter-satellite links of mega-constellations.  
The work being undertaken on the assembly of these first units represents a watershed moment for the future of LEO constellations

> “The product now being assembled in our production areas is the culmination of years of development and testing not only into the performance but also into the mass-producibility and affordability of our space terminals. As such this product is a combination of a number of factors that we knew the aerospace connectivity market wanted: secure and ultra-high bandwidth, low size, weight and power, affordability, and available in the numbers that will ensure complete constellations can be interlinked.”

> **– Bulent Altan, Member of the Mynaric Executive Board**

Without inter-satellite links, most constellations are not future-proofed or are not able to supply the high bandwidth and security needed by the builders of today’s mega-constellations. Increased use of laser inter-satellite links also reduces dependence on expensive ground infrastructure while freeing up valuable spectrum for customer links rather than ground station links. Consequently, all remaining broadband constellation projects, including newly-unveiled systems such as planned by the US Space Development Agency, rely on optical inter-satellite links, such as can be provided by CONDOR.

**About Mynaric  
**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to establish dynamic communication networks in air and space. Its laser data transmission products include ground stations and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances between aircraft, autonomous drones, high altitude platforms, satellites and the ground at high data rates.

Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its wireless laser communication products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
