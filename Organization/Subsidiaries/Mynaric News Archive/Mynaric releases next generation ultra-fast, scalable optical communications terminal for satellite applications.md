*Next-generation CONDOR Mk3 advances innovation across space applications and unlocks new performance levels for satellite constellations*

**COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado, August 25, 2021** – Mynaric debuted its next generation space terminal at the 36th Annual Space Symposium as part of its unwavering commitment to industrialize laser communication technology for the aerospace market. The CONDOR Mk3 will expand the company’s current product portfolio by providing a mass-manufacturable, smaller, lighter and low-power option, which has evolved in response to feedback that customers and the industry have given to the new product’s SDA-compliant Mk2 predecessor. The company also announced having already signed a launch customer for the newly unveiled product. The undisclosed customer is scheduled to receive initial product deliveries from Q4 2022 and has secured options for up to 20 units.

“There is a growing need for high-performance, high-bandwidth, secure and reliable connectivity in and from space,” said [Bulent Altan](https://mynaric.com/company/management/), CEO of Mynaric. “With our newest generation space product we are proud to be part of the formula for creating solutions addressing this need. CONDOR Mk3 terminals can be serially produced, ensuring affordability and allowing for large-scale deployment with short lead times for a variety of space applications.”

Key to the Mk3’s entry into the market is its scalability of both speed and production. With configurable data rate speeds between 100 Mbps and 100 Gbps, the terminal ensures both standardized compatibility with the SDA’s requirements and delivers higher speeds for different missions. Additionally, Mynaric’s commitment and investment to increased production capabilities in the United States and Germany ensures a scalably-manufactured terminal delivering on both short lead times and affordability.

“We are incredibly proud to have already secured a lead customer before even having officially launched our next generation CONDOR terminal, today,” said [Tina Ghataore](https://mynaric.com/news/mynaric-appoints-aerospace-and-communications-industry-veteran-tina-ghataore-to-lead-mynaric-usa/), Chief Commercial Officer of Mynaric. “ [The](https://spacenews.com/dod-space-agency-to-create-marketplace-for-commercial-satellite-data/) [Space Development Agency’s intent](https://spacenews.com/dod-space-agency-to-create-marketplace-for-commercial-satellite-data/) to use their Transport Layer satellites to receive data directly in space opens up completely new channels for commercial satellite operators. We are happy to be able to support such missions and more with our newest generation CONDOR terminal.”

Using best-in-class design, the CONDOR Mk3 realized significant size, weight, power and performance advantages over its product predecessors, including:

- Optical Head mass and size reduced by 30% compared to Mk2
- Optimized power consumption
- Flexible data rate coverage from 100 Mbps up to 100 Gbps
- Link distances beyond 7,500 km
- Full compliance with SDA Tranche 0 and Tranche 1 OISL Standard in the same terminal
- Adaptable to flat-panel satellite designs

**About Mynaric**

Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11) produces the optical fiber for the skies and, as a pioneer of laser communication, enables extremely fast and secure wireless data transmission between aircraft, drones and satellites. Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks such as the internet are now largely based on infrastructure on the ground which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future, therefore, calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. Mynaric provides laser communication products to establish the necessary data highways for telecommunication constellations in air and space.
