**Long Beach, Calif. April 8, 2025** – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today introduced the Company’s family of customizable, next-generation solar arrays, Standardized Array (STARRAY), to meet the diverse power needs of satellites operating in any orbital conditions. The new product line was introduced at the 40th Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

STARRAY can be tailored to meet satellite power requirements ranging from approximately 100 watts to greater than 2,000 watts, by incorporating up to four panels per wing and utilizing Rocket Lab’s highest efficiency, radiation-hardened quadruple junction solar cells. This enables unparalleled flexibility from a pre-engineered solution and optimal performance with limited investment in non-recurring engineering.

Rocket Lab boasts the world’s only vertically integrated solar array manufacturing capability, including high-volume production of solar cells, solar cell assemblies or CICs, solar panel substrates, completed solar panels and fully integrated solar arrays.

“Our objective is to offer the industry mission–specific customization with short lead times and lower costs,” said Brad Clevenger, Vice President of Space Systems at Rocket Lab. “Customers can choose from a range of pre-engineered solar array configurations to meet the needs of their application while leveraging the flight-proven reliability, performance, and speed of Rocket Lab’s vertically-integrated manufacturing."

With over 20 years of flight-heritage, Rocket Lab’s space-grade solar solutions have powered critical civil, national security and commercial space programs such as the missile awareness systems and interplanetary science missions, the James Webb Space Telescope, Space Telescope, NASA’s Artemis lunar explorations, Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, and the Mars Insight Lander. Rocket Lab's technology also serves a booming commercial satellite market, such as powering the OneWeb’s GEN1 broadband internet LEO satellite constellation. Currently, over 1,100 satellites in-orbit are powered by Rocket Lab’s solar products.
