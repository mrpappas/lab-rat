**M** **unich, 13 July 2018 –** MainFirst today initiated coverage of Mynaric (ISIN: DE000A0JCY11 / WKN: A0JCY1) with a comprehensive research report titled “Mynaric AG – High growth, non-cyclical”.

According to this initial assessment, MainFirst expects the share of the listed laser communication product manufacturer to ‘outperform’ with a target price of EUR 100 per share. Compared with the current share price of Mynaric, this represents an upside potential of about 90 percent.

MainFirst expects significant rerating of the shares “once economic feasibility of large scale networks in the sky and space has been shown and awareness about laser communication’s role as key technology in establishing aerospace networks becomes clear”. The report sees Mynaric in “an excellent position to penetrate the market and grow revenues substantially over the next years” eventually resulting in expected sales of around EUR 400m in 2022.

In addition to MainFirst, Mynaric is also continuously covered by GBC (‘buy’ rating, EUR 95 price target) and Edison (no rating). Both reports can be downloaded from the Mynaric website (see [Analyst Coverage](http://www.mynaric.com/analyst-coverage) ) where interested shareholders can also subscribe to the newsletter  (see  [News](http://www.mynaric.com/news/) ). Mynaric also continuously informs via Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter about its products, market developments and general news.

The Mynaric share is listed in the Scale segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and was included in the selective index Scale 30 February 2018.

**About Mynaric AG**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to establish dynamic communication networks in air and space. Its wireless laser data transmission products include ground stations and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances between aircrafts, autonomous drones, high altitude platforms, satellites and the ground at high data rates.

Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its wireless laser communication products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
