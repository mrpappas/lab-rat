- Mynaric announces deal for the delivery of multiple space laser communication terminals worth EUR 1.7m
- Contract confirms market demand for Mynaric’s cost-effective, serially produced laser communication inter-satellite product designed for mega-constellations

**Munich, October 17, 2019 –** Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11) has announced today that it will deliver multiple laser communication flight terminals to an undisclosed customer in an initial deal valued at EUR 1.7 million. The company’s space products are scheduled to be launched on a product validation mission which will serve as a pathfinder to integrate and qualify Mynaric’s products with the customer’s satellites.

Today’s contract announcement is clear proof that Mynaric’s cost-effective laser communication products for inter-satellite links are both commercially and technologically attractive. The selection of Mynaric’s flagship inter-satellite link terminal by the customer is affirmation of Mynaric’s leading position in the aerospace connectivity market.

> This contract win will see the first launch of our constellation terminal into space. As we complete the final stages of the terminal’s readiness and prepare for its entry into the market, we have increased the number of terminals in production to be able to support missions from additional customers, such as the one we are announcing today, at short notice.
> 
> ##### Bulent Altan, Member of the Mynaric Executive Board

Multiple units of Mynaric’s inter-satellite product are to be delivered as part of the deal. The terminal, which is set to become the market’s first available laser inter-satellite link terminal designed for satellite constellations, provides both ultra-high data rates and link distances while meeting rigorous size, weight and power consumption specifications at very competitive price-targets.

> We are very proud of the trust that our customer has placed in our product with this contract and we are delighted to have now secured our first launch opportunity. It’s great to see our vision of becoming the prime supplier of laser communication technology taking yet another huge leap forward.
> 
> ##### Markus Knapek, Co-founder of Mynaric

**About Mynaric  
**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to establish dynamic communication networks in air and space. Its wireless laser data transmission products include ground stations and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances between aircraft, autonomous drones, high altitude platforms, satellites and the ground at high data rates.

Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its wireless laser communication products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
