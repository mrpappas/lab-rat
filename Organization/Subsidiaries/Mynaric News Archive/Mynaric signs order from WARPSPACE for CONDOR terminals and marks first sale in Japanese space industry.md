*CONDOR Mk3 terminals to be used to establish an optical data relay network for LEO satellites*

**MUNICH & TOKYO, January** **24****, 2023 –** [Mynaric](https://mynaric.com/) (NASDAQ: MYNA) (FRA: M0YN), a leading provider of industrialized, cost-effective and scalable laser communications products, today announced an order for a small number of CONDOR Mk3 terminals by Japan-based WARPSPACE. The terminals will be used by WARPSPACE to establish a commercial optical data relay network for Earth observation satellites with product deliveries scheduled for 2023, 2024 and 2025.

> “WARPSPACE is building a highly capable optical data relay network in space to solve today’s communication bottleneck experienced by Earth observation satellites that need to transmit huge amounts of data to the ground in near real-time,” said **Hiromitsu Azuma, COO of WARPSPACE**. “We are happy to have found with Mynaric’s CONDOR product a suitable solution for our laser communications needs, as well as the needs of our customers. We look forward to receiving the units for subsequent satellite integration and launch.”

The order marks Mynaric’s first sale in the Japanese space industry, which is expected to grow from $9 billion today to over $30 billion by 2050, according to a [market report by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/trade/mfat-market-reports/market-reports-asia/japan-government-prioritises-space-sector-in-its-growth-strategy-feb-2022/).

> “We are grateful for WARPSPACE to entrust us with the laser communication capabilities needed for their optical data relay satellite network,” said **Tina Ghataore, CCO of Mynaric**. “With our first customer in Japan signed, we continue to earn the trust of our global customers and expand our commercial market share by delivering on our mission to make industrialized optical communications terminals widely available for a large range of applications.”
