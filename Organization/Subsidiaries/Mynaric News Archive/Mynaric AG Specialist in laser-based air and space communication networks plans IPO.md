- Mynaric AG aims to be listed in the Scale segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in autumn 2017
- Pioneer in the growth market for laser communication offering key technology for future-oriented communication networks in the air and in space
- Seeking IPO proceeds of around EUR20 million to finance growth

**Munich, 27 September 2017** – Mynaric AG, specialist in innovative laser-based communication networks in the air and in space, is preparing its IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. As part of its initial listing, which is scheduled for autumn 2017, the company plans to issue new shares from a cash capital increase to raise around EUR20 million. The issue proceeds will be used to finance the future growth of the laser technology provider.

**Innovative laser technologies for the Internet of the future**

Mynaric was founded in 2009 by former employees of the German Aerospace Centre. The company develops pioneering laser technologies used to establish global communication networks in the air and in space. Its wireless data transmission products include ground stations and laser terminals that enable very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances at high speeds, currently of up to 10 Gigabits per second.

Global demand is growing for fast and, above all, permanent Internet connection. Data networks like the Internet are now based mostly on terrestrial infrastructure, which is reaching its economic and logistical limits in providing local coverage. The quantity of generated data is rising steadily, but the cost-intensive technologies currently in use have limited capacity and range.

> “The future will demand a significant expansion of our existing network infrastructure using communication networks in the air and in space. We consider laser communication technology to be a key technology here, and we are exceptionally well positioned in this future market with our proven laser-based products, huge innovative drive and outstanding network.”  
> Dr Wolfram Peschko, Chairman of the Management Board at Mynaric AG

Laser technology in airborne communication networks can be used to provide Internet access to areas that are currently out of the reach of conventional technologies. This also means that secure, dedicated corporate networks can be built up. International corporations like Google, Facebook, SpaceX, Telesat and Airborne Wireless Network aim to use this kind of above-the-clouds communication network to connect up to three billion people who currently have no access to the Internet.

**Laser communication: A future market with high growth potential**

The market for laser communication has significant potential for growth. Most current international telecommunications and data transmission happens using optical, terrestrial networks such as optical fibre cable. This market constituted a global turnover of US$ 17 billion in 2016 and is forecast to grow by 10.5 percent per annum.

Mynaric has successfully developed and demonstrated laser technology for wireless data transmission; series production is currently in preparation. An air-to-ground connection was successfully tested back in 2013 in conjunction with Airbus subsidiary Cassidian and the German Aerospace Centre. Since then, around a dozen pre-series ground station and laser terminal products required for ground-to-air and air-to-air wireless laser communication have been produced on behalf of clients as well as the electronics, mechanics, optics and software needed for them. Laser terminals for satellites are currently in development; these will be used to establish global telecommunications networks in space using constellations of several hundred satellites.

Most of Mynaric’s current turnover comes from product tests and demonstrations for large multinational corporations. Laser technology demonstrations will form the basis of future major contracts for the establishment of complete, dynamic communication networks using platforms consisting of a variety of aircraft and spacecraft (drones, aeroplanes, balloons, satellites and so on).

**IPO proceeds to finance growth and internationalisation**

Mynaric’s strategy sees it becoming a world-leading player in the implementation of dynamic communication networks in the air and in space over the coming years.

As part of its IPO, Mynaric plans to offer new shares via a public offering in Germany and a private placement outside of Germany and the USA to raise funds totalling around EUR20 million. Existing shareholders will not sell any shares as part of the IPO.

The shares are to be listed in the Scale segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Hauck & Aufhäuser is acting as the sole global coordinator and bookrunner for the transaction.

The proceeds generated by the IPO are to be used primarily for the planned launch of series production. The funds shall also be used for the further development of laser terminals for the use in space and for the general advancement of product performance as well as ongoing internationalisation.
