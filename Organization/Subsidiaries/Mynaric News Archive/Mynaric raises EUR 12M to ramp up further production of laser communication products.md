**Munich, February 4, 2020** – Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11), a world leader in the design, development and manufacture of laser communication products for high-speed connectivity in air and space, has successfully raised EUR 12.3 million via a private placement of newly issued shares to qualified investors. The placement round was substantially oversubscribed.

Today’s funding comes at the beginning of a year in which Mynaric expects to witness the commercial inflection point for laser communication in aerospace applications. Mynaric recently announced its first contract win of the year and is now focused on preparing for a pronounced uptick in demand for its laser communication products in 2020.  
Consequently, the net proceeds of the capital increase will be used primarily to support and consolidate Mynaric’s position in the market.

Funds will be used to facilitate:

- Continued ramp-up of production of laser communication products for applications in air and space. Mynaric currently has over 30 units in production schedule for 2020 – a number unheard of in the history of laser communication.
- Increased customer acquisition efforts, particularly by expanding activities in the USA such as creating US-designed and US-sourced electronics and software.
- Securing and strengthening Mynaric’s market position through advanced developments for next generation technologies.

> The timing of this funding is perfect, with our products becoming available just as demand is beginning to pick up. Billions of Euros are due to be invested in satellite constellations and these space and airborne customers are hungry for secure wireless communication. Both of these markets are eager to get their hands on first available laser communication products to prepare large-scale deployments and we stand ready to supply just that.”

**About Mynaric**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to enable communication and surveillance applications in air and space. Its laser data transmission products include ground and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly and securely over long distances between aircraft, autonomous drones, high-altitude platforms, satellites and the ground.

Globally, the need for fast and secure connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or practical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its wireless laser communication products Mynaric is positioned as a prime pioneer in this growth market.
