**Munich, November 12, 2018 –** Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, Scale 50, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11) has been awarded the Deloitte ‘Technology Fast 50 Innovation Award’, bestowed for an outstanding, innovative business model, product or trend-setting technology.

The award, given at a special ceremony in Cologne, recognizes Mynaric’s innovation in developing laser communication products and technology to enable extremely fast and secure wireless data transmission between aircraft, drones and satellites – an internet above the clouds.

> Several fast-growing German companies have positioned themselves in future-oriented fields of technology over the past few years. This is the work of entrepreneurs who are able to put their visions into action through their risk tolerance and business acumen. With the Fast 50 Award we want to recognise exceptional entrepreneurial achievements in Germany, making it a prime technology location.

> ##### Dr Andreas Gentner, Partner and Head of Technology, Media & Telecommunications EMEA at Deloitte

The granting of the award is also recognition of Mynaric’s business model to serially produce laser communication products for aerospace communication networks. Indeed, the company announced in September that it had begun series manufacturing of its ground stations for air and space applications, making it the leading supplier of optical ground stations.

> We are delighted and honored to receive the Innovation Award from Deloitte for our work on creating the backbone connectivity needed by the builders of the next generation of aerospace telecommunication networks. The award is recognition of both the ground-breaking work our highly-skilled staff are doing as well as conformation that as a company we are on the right track to becoming the leading supplier of laser communication products to our industry.

**About Mynaric  
**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to establish dynamic communication networks in air and space. Its wireless laser data transmission products include ground stations and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances between aircraft, autonomous drones, high altitude platforms, satellites and the ground at high data rates.

Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its wireless laser communication products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
