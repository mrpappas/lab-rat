**Los Angeles, CA, and Washington, D.C., May 26, 2021 –** Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11) has successfully demonstrated the industry’s first implementation of the Optical Inter-Satellite Link (OISL) Standard of the Space Development Agency (SDA). The demonstration marks a crucial milestone in the industrialization of laser communication and, as such, a first step in the technology’s widespread adoption within the satellite industry and beyond.

Mynaric has achieved the industry’s first over-the-air transmission using an OISL terminal communicating with an independently built testbed both of which are compliant with the SDA’s OISL standard. The demonstration was composed of a set of optical and electronic tests characterizing Mynaric’s CONDOR optical inter-satellite link product. The successful demonstration is confirmation that Mynaric’s product are downward compliant with the SDA OISL Standard, thus ensuring baseline compatibility with products of other OISL vendors implementing the same standard.

> “In the quest to support the SDA and other governmental customers in our core markets, it is important that we help bridge the differences between the commercial and governmental markets, and reduce the risks of technology adoption. Standardization is crucial in facilitating both objectives and we are excited to be leading the field with our CONDOR line of terminals.  
> We are proud to have yet another industry first under our belt.”  
> **Bulent Altan, CEO, Mynaric**

The demonstration marks yet another positive achievement in support of SDA’s efforts to establish the National Defense Space Architecture, a large-scale satellite constellation providing a range of capabilities to U.S. warfighters and to be comprised of several hundred laser-linked satellites. After procuring first satellites for the program last year, SDA is currently seeking industry feedback on its approach to procure the next tranche of up to 150 satellites, each equipped with optical links.

Mynaric is currently in the process of setting up a laser communication link testbed at its Los Angeles facilities which will replicate the already-established facility at its headquarters in Munich. The internal testing facilities will allow Mynaric to fully test its terminals and their compliance with the SDA OISL standard in-house to further reduce development time. They will also allow third parties to test their compatibility with Mynaric’s products.

**About SDA**

Speed. Delivery. Agility. Recognized as the Department of Defense’s constructive disruptor for space acquisition, the Space Development Agency (SDA) will quickly deliver needed space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions through development, fielding, and operation of the National Defense Space Architecture. SDA capitalizes on a unique business model that values speed and lowers costs by harnessing commercial development to achieve a proliferated architecture and enhance resilience. SDA will deliver a minimum viable product – on time, every two years- by employing spiral development methods, adding capabilities to future generations as the threat evolves.

**About Mynaric**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to enable communication and surveillance applications in air and space. Its laser data transmission products include ground and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly and securely over long distances between aircraft, autonomous drones, high-altitude platforms, satellites and the ground.

Globally, the need for fast and secure connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or practical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its laser data transmission products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
