**Los Angeles, August 19, 2021 –** Mynaric — a pioneer of laser communication — will exhibit at the 36th Space Symposium from August 23-26, 2021, in service of strengthening its U.S. presence. Located at Exhibition Center North Booth #1351, Mynaric sales representatives and leadership will be available to discuss laser communication solutions for space and aerospace applications, its serial production capabilities, investments in its US operations and initial success with clients.

> “Mynaric is at the forefront of the industrial revolution of laser communications. We are excited to attend the Space Symposium where we will showcase innovative products available in serial production. It’s a major milestone for our team to show industry friends and peers how we have taken the vision of global connectivity and proven a way to make it a reality.”

At the show, Mynaric will have both of its flagship [product lines](https://mynaric.com/products/) on display and unveil its next generation space terminal particularly suited for serial production and scaled deployment. The featured product lines will be:

- **CONDOR**: The CONDOR optical communications terminal is purpose built to address the growing need of high-performance, high-bandwidth, secure and reliable inter-satellite links for next-generation satellite constellations. The terminal is capable of establishing links for intra-plane and cross-plane operation scenarios in various orbits and Space-Space, Space-Air, Space-Ground communication.
- **HAWK**: The HAWK is an optical communications terminal for secure real-time communication for a wide array of airborne platforms. It is manufactured with the most advanced optical wireless technology and designed for small size, weight and power (SWaP). The bidirectional and synchronous communication terminal is optimized for Air-Air and Air-Ground applications.

During the Space Symposium, Tina Ghataore will serve as a panelist during the Game Changers session on Thursday, August 26 at 2:00 p.m. Mynaric will also host a Cosmic Constellation Cocktails happy hour event at its booth on Tuesday, August 24, from 5-7 p.m.

**About Mynaric**

Mynaric (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: M0Y, ISIN: DE000A0JCY11) produces the optical fiber for the skies and, as a pioneer of laser communication, enables extremely fast and secure wireless data transmission between aircraft, drones and satellites. Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks such as the internet are now largely based on infrastructure on the ground which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future, therefore, calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. Mynaric provides laser communication products to establish the necessary data highways for telecommunication constellations in air and space.
