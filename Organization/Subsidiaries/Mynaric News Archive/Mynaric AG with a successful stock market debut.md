**Munich, 30 October 2017** – Mynaric AG, a specialist for innovative laser-based communication networks in air and in space, has today given its successful stock market debut. In the course of this morning the share price rose to more than 57.00 Euro. This is an increase of more than six per cent compared to the issue price of 54.00 Euro.

> “The successful IPO is an important milestone for us. There is great interest in our products for the realization of the internet above the clouds. With the funds from the IPO we have the opportunity to generate significant growth,”  
> Dr. Wolfram Peschko, Chief Executive Officer of Mynaric AG

The generated gross issuance proceeds of 27.3 million euros are intended primarily for the creation of serial production capabilities. This requires investments in measurement systems and assembly. In addition, the proceeds are to be used to fund the further development of laser terminals for space, the general improvement of the performance of the products and continued internationalisation.

The offering of Mynaric AG included up to 440,000 shares from a capital increase and an overallotment option (‘green-shoe option’) consisting of up to 66,000 shares, also from a capital increase. All 506,000 shares offered were placed.

The Mynaric AG shares carry the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) DE000A0JCY11 and the securities identification number (WKN) A0JCY1.

Hauck & Aufhäuser acted as sole global coordinator and bookrunner for the IPO.
