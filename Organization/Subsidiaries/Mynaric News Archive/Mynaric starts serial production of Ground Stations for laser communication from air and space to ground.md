- Company announces start of serial production of Optical Ground Stations
- Serial production follows delivery of first Optical Ground Station for satellite communications to customer
- Milestone positions Mynaric as only commercial supplier of Optical Ground Stations already in serial production

**Munich, 11 September 2018** – Mynaric can announce today that it has progressed to serial production of its two types of Optical Ground Stations for laser communication of airborne and space platforms to the ground.

The onset of serial production of the full ground segment follows the initial delivery of the first Optical Ground Station for satellite communications which has successfully passed the site acceptance test of the respective customer. This delivered first unit is now set to establish high speed bidirectional links with satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), achieving data rates of up to 10 Gbps over distances up to 1,400 km.

> “The delivery of this ground station for space communications now proves the efficacy of the company’s in-house development and production processes – elements that are key to placing Mynaric as the ‘go-to’ provider of laser communication products. Following this first produced unit we are now ramping up our efforts to manufacture Ground Stations for connecting space assets at scale.”  
> Dr Markus Knapek, founder and board member of Mynaric  

The systems and processes used in the preparation and delivery of this Ground Station have been harnessed to ensure seamlessness and coherence in the company’s move to serial production.

Both versions of Mynaric’s Ground Stations – for airborne and space applications – are now being produced in series with multiple units of each Ground Station available for delivery by the first quarter of 2019.

This positions Mynaric as the only commercial supplier of Optical Ground Stations already in serial production for the burgeoning market in laser communications.

> “This is another substantive milestone and one which further vindicates our focused business strategy of devoting all of our financial and engineering efforts  
> into market-changing serial manufacture.”  
> Dr. Wolfram Peschko, the CEO of Mynaric

**About Mynaric’s Optical Ground Stations**

The Optical Ground Stations have an aperture size of 200 to 400 mm and are designed for optical communication with aircraft or satellites in low Earth orbit. They can achieve data rates of 10 Gbps over distances of 50km (air) or 1400 km (space) and employ advanced software algorithms to compensate for atmospheric distortions. They are based on an innovative pointing mechanism, with low power consumption and heat dissipation optimized to support both fixed and mobile communication links.

**About Mynaric AG**

Mynaric is a manufacturer of laser communication technologies used to establish dynamic communication networks in air and space. Its wireless laser data transmission products include ground stations and flight terminals, which allow very large quantities of data to be sent wirelessly over long distances between aircrafts, autonomous drones, high altitude platforms, satellites and the ground at high data rates.

Globally, the need for fast and ubiquitous network connectivity is advancing inexorably. Data networks are today largely based on infrastructure on the ground, which cannot be expanded arbitrarily for legal, economic or logistical reasons. The future therefore calls for an expansion of the existing network infrastructure into air and space. With its wireless laser communication products Mynaric is positioned as a pioneer in this growth market.
