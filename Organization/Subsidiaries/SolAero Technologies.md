SolAero Technologies is a leading provider of high-performance solar cells, solar panels, and composite structural products for spacecraft. Based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the company is renowned for its space-grade photovoltaics, which power satellites, space probes, and rovers, including high-profile missions like NASA's James Webb Space Telescope and Mars rovers. SolAeroâ€™s advanced manufacturing capabilities and lightweight designs make it a key supplier for commercial, civil, and national security space programs.

## ðŸ’° Acquisition

In January 2022, Rocket Lab acquired SolAero Technologies for $80 million in cash to expand its space systems division. The acquisition added SolAeroâ€™s cutting-edge solar technologies to Rocket Labâ€™s portfolio, enabling the company to vertically integrate satellite manufacturing with in-house solar power solutions. By acquiring one of the worldâ€™s leading suppliers of space solar panels, Rocket Lab aimed to reduce costs, ensure supply chain reliability, and offer more comprehensive satellite and mission support for commercial, civil, and government customers.
