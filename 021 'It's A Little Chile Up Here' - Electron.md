>[!success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
Rocket Lab launched a dedicated mission for the United States Space Force (USSF) and deployed a single research and development satellite to low Earth orbit.
>
Rocket Lab carried the Monolith satellite for the USSF's Space Test Program (STP) to space to explore and demonstrate the use of a deployable sensor, where the sensor‚Äôs mass is a substantial fraction of the total mass of the spacecraft, changing the spacecraft‚Äôs dynamic properties and testing ability to maintain spacecraft attitude control. Analysis from the use of a deployable sensor aims to enable the use of smaller satellite buses when building future deployable sensors such as weather satellites, thereby reducing the cost, complexity, and development timelines.
>
The mission was named ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a Little Chile Up Here‚Äô in a nod to the beloved green chile of New Mexico where the Space Test Program is based. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a Little Chile Up Here‚Äô was Rocket Lab‚Äôs fourth launch for the year and the company‚Äôs 21st Electron launch overall.
