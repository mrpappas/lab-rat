This mission lifted-off at 14:22 NZDT, 17th October 2019, from Rocket Lab's [[./Launch Complex 1|Launch Complex 1]] on New Zealand’s Māhia Peninsula. Encapsulated in Electron’s fairing was a single spacecraft for Astro Digital, a California-based satellite manufacturer and operator.
>
Astro Digital provides customers with complete space-based systems and mission support services for applications such as Earth observation, satellite communications, and technology demonstration.
>
This mission flew a Palisade technology demonstration satellite, a 16U CubeSat bus with on-board propulsion system, a next generation Astro Digital developed communications system, and software developed by Advanced Solutions Inc. including an advanced version of ASI’s MAX Flight Software.
>
The mission was named ‘As The Crow Flies’ in a nod to Astro Digital’s Corvus Platform, which provides flexible and cost-effective solutions across a wide range of applications and mission profiles on bus variants ranging from 6U and 16U CubeSats to ESPA Class. Corvus is also a widely-distributed genus of birds which includes crows.
