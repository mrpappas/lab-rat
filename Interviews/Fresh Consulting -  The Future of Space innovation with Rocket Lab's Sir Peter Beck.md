## üéôÔ∏è Transcript

### Introduction

**Jeff Dance:** Welcome to The Future of, a podcast by Fresh Consulting where we discuss and learn about the future of different industries, markets and technology verticals. I'm your host Jeff Dance.

In this episode, we're joined by Sir Peter Beck, who is the founder, president and chief executive of Rocket Lab. Today we'll be exploring the future of space innovation.

Sir Peter, welcome to the show.

**Sir Peter Beck:** Yeah, pleasure to be here. Thanks for joining from New Zealand.

**Jeff:** Which part of New Zealand are you in?

**Sir Peter:** Our factories here are in Auckland and the launch site is over on the east coast - about a 2-hour helicopter flight or an 8-hour drive.

**Jeff:** Amazing, beautiful place to be. Having been in helicopters in New Zealand doing some heli-skiing is just mind-blowing - the terrain you have there. So you're blending a lot of amazing things together.

**Sir Peter:** Yeah, it's a good way to go.

### Background and Company Overview

**Jeff:** For people that haven't heard of Rocket Lab or Sir Peter - Sir Peter Beck is the founder, president and CEO of Rocket Lab. Sir Peter has led the development of Rocket Lab's satellite launching rocket Electron, which as of April 2025 has launched 63 times and is now the second most frequently launched US rocket. Congratulations.

He's also an adjunct professor in aerospace engineering at the University of Auckland. In 2024, Peter was made a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the aerospace industry, business and education. He's also been presented with numerous medals like the gold medal from the Royal Aeronautical Society - really impressive background.

As far as Rocket Lab, it was founded back in 2006, correct?

**Sir Peter:** Correct.

**Jeff:** And it's a global end-to-end space company delivering launch services, spacecraft, satellite components and on-orbit management. Really interesting company as we think about the future of space.

### Why Space?

**Jeff:** I wanted to start with - why space? There's not many people in the industry. It's a growing industry, but what kind of drew you to this career early on and has kept you so dedicated to it?

**Sir Peter:** Well, the space industry is ridiculously difficult, and like a lot of entrepreneurial endeavors, it's also very, very painful. So you have to have some level of passion to endure it, if you will.

For me, one of my youngest childhood memories I actually have is standing outside with my father and he pointed to the night sky and said, "Well, all of those stars - well, the majority of those stars are suns. And they could have, you know, a lot of them have planets around them, and there could be somebody standing on that planet looking back at you." 

And that was kind of the moment - I was like, "Right, this is really quite interesting and this is where I have to spend my time." So I was very lucky that I knew from almost some of my youngest memories exactly what I wanted to do and was able to guide my career to doing exactly that.

**Jeff:** Congratulations. You have an interesting evolution - not many people get into this opportunity. What do you think helped catapult yourself into being both a founder and CEO of a successful company in space?

**Sir Peter:** My original plan was to go to the US and work for NASA, but as a foreign national with no aerospace degree, that proved very troublesome. So really, I did the only logical thing that you could do, which was go back to my home country and start a company. I can't say that the original design was to go and start a company - it was just the only pathway that I could see that would get me to where I wanted to go. *(3:00)*

### Rocket Lab's Government Projects

**Jeff:** We noticed that Rocket Lab was selected to provide hypersonic test launch capability and other services to both the UK government and the US government. Tell us more about that.

**Sir Peter:** The Electron rocket, which is our small orbital class rocket, has been very successful in delivering hundreds of satellites to orbit. We were kind of tapped on the shoulder to try and provide this new capability, which is a suborbital capability to test hypersonic platforms and programs. It's really taking a product that we already had and extending it to provide these useful services. *(5:00)*

### End-to-End Space Company Strategy

**Jeff:** Your website says that you're transforming the way we use and access space. Tell us more about your strategy with tackling it from multiple angles.

**Sir Peter:** Some days I wake up and wish we just did one thing, but the reality is we're trying to build an end-to-end space company. What that means is typically the space industry is very bifurcated - you have little companies doing very bespoke, unique things all at subscale. That's all great if you're building like one or two things a year and launching them, but when you're trying to build a constellation of hundreds or thousands of spacecraft, then that becomes very challenging.

Our view is that obviously launch is the enabler - having the keys to space is really the most important thing. So that's why we have our Electron rocket and soon-to-fly Neutron rocket. But very quickly thereafter, if you can combine the ability to launch stuff and also build the satellite at the same time, then it becomes a very powerful way of deploying infrastructure to orbit really quickly.

One of the first things we did was lay a satellite out on a component level on a boardroom table and asked everybody to point to everything that sucked - either from a technology perspective, supply chain perspective, or cost perspective. I can tell you there was almost no component left that wasn't being pointed to.

As we started to go through that, we methodically went out and did a couple of different things: we either acquired the best technology and the best companies and then subsequently scaled those to actually produce at scale, or we started our own internal R&D programs. Generally, if you go to the vast majority of the space industry and say you want to order a thousand of something, you just watch people's heads kind of spontaneously combust because that is a number that is just not common within the space industry. *(7:00)*

### Competition Landscape

**Jeff:** How do you guys differ from some of the other major players in space? Are any of them providing the full end-to-end services that you guys are providing?

**Sir Peter:** From an end-to-end perspective, there's not really anybody. But in various component levels, there's some competitors - some very robust competitors, and then some things there just isn't competition for.

Take space solar as a good example - there are three providers of space-grade solar cells in the entire world: one in the US and one in Europe. Between these three companies, they provide all of the space-grade solar cells for the world, and we're now the largest in all of that.

The space industry is a weird industry because we'll go head-to-head with a prime on a big space mission, and then if we don't win, that prime turns around and orders a whole bunch of components from us and we're now a teammate. It's kind of a competitive mate industry where you can be in raucous competition and then the next day we're having a kickoff meeting and we're best of friends. *(10:00)*

### Industry Challenges

**Jeff:** What do you see as some of the biggest challenges that the space industry is up against?

**Sir Peter:** I mean, look, what we do is really hard. Like the space environment is nasty - think of the nastiest environment you can and then make it a bit worse. There's the old saying "space is hard," which even today is proven to be absolutely true.

But I think one of the biggest challenges in the space industry is not really the technology - it is just the ability to scale. Because it has been a cottage industry for so long, the industry really hasn't built a good infrastructure supply chain and all of those things to be able to scale quickly.

Our customers come to us and scale and schedule is number one, technology is number two, and then price is number three. The scarcity of launch, the scarcity of so many components and bits and pieces - that's the biggest challenge facing the industry right now. *(13:00)*

### Customer Mix and Market Opportunities

**Jeff:** What is the mix between government and commercial customers?

**Sir Peter:** We like to hold sort of 50/50 - so 50% government, 50% commercial. A number of other companies can be 100% government or 100% commercial, but it's fair to say that government's definitely a large customer of this industry because a lot of the infrastructure that goes in orbit is government-related, whether it's civil or defense.

**Jeff:** What are some of the market opportunities you see that are really hot right now for space?

**Sir Peter:** I think commercial comms is a huge opportunity, and we're right at the very beginning of this. This is a very early execution of the system. I've always said that I think the biggest application in space hasn't even been thought of yet. With this kind of direct device comms and internet from space, it's really been enabled by low-cost access to space.

A good analogy to think about it is when the internet was first created - it feels like we've sent our first email. That's where we are in the progression of what you can do in space - we're at the baby stage of where it's going. *(16:00)*

### Space Traffic Management

**Jeff:** With so many more satellites being launched, do you see a crowding problem up there?

**Sir Peter:** Space is big. If you took all the spacecraft that are in orbit, it would probably fit in a football paddock, so there's not that much metal flying around in orbit in the grand scheme of things. However, it's also kind of like having a highway with zero rules - no traffic lights, no intersections, doesn't matter if you're going up the road or down the road.

When the highway is not busy, then the chances of you t-boning somebody is pretty low, but as the highway gets busier and busier, those chances continue to increase until it becomes inevitable. There is going to have to be a global space traffic management thing - we need traffic control in space, just like aviation.

The challenge is that it's not like just the US can put this in place because everybody's going around the planet every 90 minutes. All of the countries, the whole globe, has to get together and agree on a set of rules and norms that would enable space traffic management. *(18:00)*

I did go to the UN a number of years ago and talked about this. It was singularly the most inspiring and depressing thing at the same time because it was great that all the countries turned up to talk about this, so clearly everyone recognizes it's a global issue. But everybody read their own pre-prepared statement, and at the end of it I was like, "Right, let's just go and have a whiteboard session and sort this out," and there was deafening silence.

Within the UN, there hadn't been a global outer space rule agreed since the 1970s when the Outer Space Treaty was signed. *(20:00)*

### Vision for the Future

**Jeff:** What do you envision 10 to 20 years ahead?

**Sir Peter:** I think overall, everybody will be much more connected to the space layer in everybody's everyday lives. Already it is, but most people don't realize it. Whether - I mean, like you order a pizza, the reality is that's come from space now. That sounds like a crazy thing to say, but if it wasn't for GPS, your pizza would not have turned up at your house.

There's everyday stuff that we do that is relying on space infrastructure, but it's just hidden infrastructure and it's just not that obvious. I think satellite comms has become a little bit more obvious because everybody knows that they're talking to a satellite.

As that becomes normalized, we'll look back and go, "I remember those days when you didn't have ubiquitous cell phone reception, remember having to sit on a plane and the maximum you could do was an email." All of these things - it's not five or 10 years, this is like 10 months away.

I think there'll be pretty significant quality of life changes to a lot of folks because of the space infrastructure. If you look at the world and what are the distinguishing factors between a first world nation and a third world nation - it's largely education. If you can take an online Stanford course in a mud hut in Africa, then your quality of life is going to improve. Having that ubiquitous dissemination of information and knowledge is going to be great. *(24:00)*

### Role of AI in Space

**Jeff:** How do AI and computer vision tie into how things are accelerating in space?

**Sir Peter:** You can bisect that into on-the-ground doing the creation and then in-orbit. From the in-orbit perspective, you've got Earth observation satellites taking images and imaging the whole world every day. If you're imaging the whole world every day, then you can see a lot of stuff, and that's just like the ultimate example for machine learning and AI to build terabytes of database every day and then just query it.

It's like, "I wonder what happened over here, or are there any changes in the forest today?" "Yeah, there were like 20 people cutting all these trees down this afternoon." You don't have to go hunting for that - it's just a query of a database. That becomes very powerful.

**Jeff:** So we can grab this large data set on a daily basis almost as a large language model, and then because we have the AI of today as a conversational interface over that large database, we can query the changes of the world on a real-time basis?

**Sir Peter:** Totally. You should have Will from Planet Labs on your show and get and talk to Will about that, because this is exactly what Planet Labs as a company is doing.

The other part is on the ground. When every Electron flies, there's about half a terabyte of data that comes down from each flight. We have like 15,000 channels of data acquisition on that launch vehicle. If you were just some poor engineer sat at a desk trying to compare, "Was that combustion chamber profile of chamber E9 the same as the last 60 flights or was it different?" - you can do that, it just takes a lot of time. But being able to ingest that and just query through AI and then pull some insights out of that - that's just one example where we're deploying AI throughout our business. *(28:00)*

### Future Talent Needs

**Jeff:** What would you say to those interested in getting involved as far as the types of engineers or specialists that we'll need in the future?

**Sir Peter:** Firstly, find your passion, because there's going to be highs and man, there's going to be some lows. In the space industry, you literally work your butt off for months or years for one giant event that either will go spectacularly well or spectacularly bad. So you need to be very passionate about what you do.

One of the areas that we continually struggle for is mechanical engineers. I'm sure AI will certainly help a mechanical engineer develop various things, but there's a bit of a blurry line, especially in the space industry, between good design - a blurred line between art and engineering or art and science. The very best designs look incredibly simple, but they've probably taken the longest to do because that's just what good design looks like.

Software and coding, there's always going to be some really niche stuff there, but as we see over time, the more mundane tasks AI can do a great job of. Don't forget - you need the hardware to do the software. *(32:00)*

### Most Exciting Future Advancements

**Jeff:** What are some of the advancements in space technology that you're personally most excited for?

**Sir Peter:** The thing that I'm most excited for doesn't exist. The biggest limiting factor for any space activity is the fact that somewhere between 1 and 5% of the total mass of the rocket is the actual thing you put into orbit. If Earth's gravity was just a little bit higher, we wouldn't get anything to orbit.

We achieved combustion optimum efficiency back in the '60s, so there is no propellant combination that you can put together to make a higher-performing rocket engine. That's it - hydrogen oxygen, that's your lot. And the trouble is that even with that, it's like 1 to 5% total mass is the thing you put into orbit.

If we truly want to be a space-faring civilization and transit the solar system, man, we've got to find a way better job than burning dinosaurs to get off this planet. Chemical propulsion works, but it just works so poorly. I'm rooting for the antimatter drive, the ion drive, or some other alternative drive.

Nuclear is awesome - you can get the best you can get from a hydrogen oxygen engine is about 400 seconds of ISP (a measure of performance or efficiency). Nuclear engine, you can get up into the thousands, which is great. It's just a little bit of an issue that you've got a nasty stream of radiation all the way to orbit, which is suboptimal. But in space, it's a great technology. The hardest thing is getting off the planet. *(35:00)*

### Most Rewarding Experience

**Jeff:** What's the most rewarding experience that you've had in the industry so far?

**Sir Peter:** That's a really tricky question - that's almost asking me to talk about my feelings. The technology and the accomplishments are awesome. We went to the moon with a mission off Electron, that was amazing. We've reentered capsules, there's just been so many technology moments or spacecraft or space moments that have been amazing.

But I guess one of the most satisfying things for me is actually just watching the team grow. I think back to when we were just a bunch of, in many cases, graduate engineers kicking around in a little lab, and those guys now are vice presidents running big parts of the company, responsible for huge things and are amazing people.

Even today, I induct everybody who comes into the company, and it's always really - doing it long enough that I've seen enough really early-stage graduate engineers who you sort of know because they're just full of beans and going to make it happen no matter what. That's one of the great things about Rocket Lab - you can start as a graduate engineer and end up as a vice president in a relatively short period of time if you kick ass. That's super fun to watch. *(38:00)*


**Jeff:** It's our pleasure to have you on this show and grateful, Sir Peter Beck, for what you're doing and your passion - we can hear it, can kind of feel it. So congrats again and thank you for coming on.
