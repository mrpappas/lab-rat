## üéôÔ∏è Transcript

### Introduction (0:40)

**Jeff Dance:**  In this episode, we're joined by Sir Peter Beck, who is the founder, president and chief executive of Rocket Lab. Today we'll be exploring the future of space innovation.

Sir Peter, welcome to the show.

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, pleasure to be here. Thanks for joining from New Zealand.

**Jeff:** Which part of New Zealand are you in?

**Peter:** Our factories here are in Auckland and the launch site is over on the east coast - about a 2-hour helicopter flight or an 8-hour drive.

**Jeff:** Amazing, beautiful place to be. Having been in helicopters in New Zealand doing some heli-skiing is just mind-blowing - the terrain you have there. So you're blending a lot of amazing things together.

**Peter:** Yeah, it's a good way to go.

### Background and Company Overview (01:26)

**Jeff:** For people that haven't heard of Rocket Lab or Sir Peter - Sir Peter Beck is the founder, president and CEO of Rocket Lab. Sir Peter has led the development of Rocket Lab's satellite launching rocket Electron, which as of April 2025 has launched 63 times and is now the second most frequently launched US rocket. Congratulations.

He's also an adjunct professor in aerospace engineering at the University of Auckland. In 2024, Peter was made a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the aerospace industry, business and education. He's also been presented with numerous medals like the gold medal from the Royal Aeronautical Society - really impressive background.

As far as Rocket Lab, it was founded back in 2006, correct?

**Peter:** Correct.

**Jeff:** And it's a global end-to-end space company delivering launch services, spacecraft, satellite components and on-orbit management. Really interesting company as we think about the future of space.

### Why Space? (02:40)

**Jeff:** I wanted to start with - why space? There's not many people in the industry. We work for a couple space companies, but there's not many of them, I know It's a growing industry, but what kind of drew you to this career early on and has kept you so dedicated to it?

**Peter:** Well, the space industry is raucously difficult, and like a lot of entrepreneurial endeavors, it's also very, very painful. So you have to have some level of passion to endure it, if you will.

For me, one of my youngest childhood memories I actually have is standing outside with my father and he pointed to the night sky and said, "Well, all of those stars - well, the majority of those stars are suns. And they could have, you know, a lot of them have planets around them, and there could be somebody standing on that planet looking back at you." 

And that was kind of the moment - I was like, "Right, this is really quite interesting and this is where I have to spend my time." So I was very lucky that I knew from almost some of my youngest memories exactly what I wanted to do and was able to guide my career to doing exactly that.

**Jeff:** Congratulations. You have an interesting evolution as we think about your career and kind of where you started and where you are now - it's not many people get into this opportunity. What do you think helped catapult yourself into being both a founder and CEO of a successful company in space?

**Peter:** My original plan was to go to the US and work for NASA, but as a foreign national with no aerospace degree, that proved very troublesome. So really, I did the only logical thing that you could do, which was go back to my home country and start a company. I can't say that the original design was to go and start a company - it was just the only pathway that I could see that would get me to where I wanted to go.
### Rocket Lab's Government Projects (04:47)

**Jeff:** NASA's a good place too but we need more organizations around the world given where the future is space is going. We noticed that Rocket Lab was selected to provide hypersonic test launch capability and other services to both the UK government and the US government. Tell us more about that.

**Peter:** The Electron rocket, which is our small orbital class rocket, has been very successful in delivering hundreds of satellites to orbit. We were kind of tapped on the shoulder to try and provide this new capability, which is a suborbital capability to test hypersonic platforms and programs. It's really taking a product that we already had and extending it to on to provide these useful services.

### End-to-End Space Company Strategy (5:40)

**Jeff**: It's interesting looking at your company because you guys do more than one thing, you know as an End-to-End Space Company relates to space, there's the the satellites, the spacecraft, the subsystems, so you're not quite like in a singular thing.

**Jeff:** Your website says that you're transforming the way we use and access space. Tell us more about your strategy with tackling it from multiple angles.

**Peter:** Some days I wake up and wish we just did one thing, but the reality is we're trying to build an end-to-end space company. What does that mean? What that means is typically the space industry is very bifurcated - you have little companies doing very bespoke, unique things all at subscale. That's all great if you're building like one or two things a year and launching them, but when you're trying to build a constellation of hundreds or thousands of spacecraft, then that becomes very challenging.

Our view is that obviously launch is the enabler - having the keys to space is really the most important thing. So that's why we have our Electron rocket and soon-to-fly Neutron rocket. But very quickly thereafter, if you can combine the ability to launch stuff and also build the satellite at the same time, then it becomes a very powerful way of deploying infrastructure to orbit really quickly.

One of the first things we did was lay a satellite out on a component level on a boardroom table and asked everybody to point to everything that sucked - either from a technology perspective, supply chain perspective, or cost perspective. I can tell you there was almost no component left that wasn't being pointed to.

As we started to go through that, we methodically went out and did a couple of different things: we either acquired the best technology and the best companies and then subsequently scaled those to actually produce at scale, or we started our own internal R&D programs. With ultimately the same end result of providing at scale. Generally, if you go to the vast majority of the space industry and you rock on up and say you want to order a thousand of something, you just watch people's heads kind of spontaneously combust because that is a number that is just not common within the space industry. But as you think about where the space industry is going and the proliferated LEO architecture, as in putting up a bunch of satellites to provide services to all of us down here, then somebody has to be responsible for the ability to scale the satellites, the components that go with them, and launch. My prediction for the future here is it's going to become pretty blurry as to what is a space company and what is a services company. I mean take our friends over at SpaceX right now um is SpaceX a space company or is it a communication services company providing internet, it becomes pretty blurry pretty quickly but the one thing that's true
there is that if you have the ability to build the infrastructure and deploy it through through launching it all by yourself then it creates a capability and a moat that unless you have that capability that's very very difficult to compete with so you know we we've just sort of in in traditional rocket lab style gone through gone through and about this in a very methodical way picking off each bit of technology and each bit of capability one after the other to ultimately you know build this this end to end space company which is unique in in the industry

### Competition Landscape (10:27)

(Interviewer talks about parallels to his own business)

**Jeff:** How do you guys differ from some of the other players in space? You mentioned SpaceX, who are some other players you guys are competing against? Are none of them providing the full end-to-end services that you guys are providing?

**Peter:** From an end-to-end perspective, there's not really anybody. But in various component levels, there's some competitors - some very robust competitors, and then some things there just isn't competition for.

Take space solar as a good example - there are three providers of space-grade solar cells in the entire world: one in the US and one in Europe. Between these three companies, they provide all of the space-grade solar cells for the world, and we're now the largest in all of that. There's an example where there's really on two other competitors, and that's not uncommon given the complexity and the scale of the nature of some of these things. Where as reaction wheels for example, there's probably about a dozen companies or so providing that particular product.

The space industry is a weird industry because we'll go head-to-head with a prime on a big space mission, and then if we don't win, that prime turns around and orders a whole bunch of components from us and we're now a teammate. It's kind of a competitive-mate industry where you can be in raucous competition and then the next day we're having a kickoff meeting and we're best of friends. 

### Industry Challenges (12:30)

**Jeff:** What are some of the other, we've heard you know in space obviously there's the extreme cost that are coming down with companies like yourself, but there's the legal side there's the sustainability side, we've talked in a previous episode we talked about all the space debris that's up there there's some of the technology side from unreliable kind of communications or limitations but what do you see as some of the biggest challenges that the space industry is up against?

**Peter:** When you put it like that it's a little bit depressing I wish it was a bit easier to be honest with you, I mean, look, what we do is really hard. Like the space environment is nasty - think of the nastiest environment you can and then make it a bit worse. It's a really really difficult thing to do and there's the old saying "space is hard," which even today is proven to be absolutely true.

But I think one of the biggest challenges in the space industry is not really the technology - it is just the ability to scale. Because it has been a cottage industry for so long, that the industry really hasn't built a good infrastructure supply chain and all of those things to be able to scale quickly.

That's the one thing I'd say our customers come to us and scale and schedule is number one, technology is number two, and then price is number three. That will change over time but the scarcity of launch, the scarcity of so many components and bits and pieces - that's the biggest challenge facing the industry right now. 

### Customer Mix and Market Opportunities (14:25)

**Jeff:** As far as the makeup of customers, What is the mix between government and commercial customers?

**Peter:** We like to hold sort of 50/50 - so 50% government, 50% commercial. A number of other companies can be 100% government or 100% commercial, but it's fair to say that government's definitely a large customer of this industry because a lot of the infrastructure that goes in orbit is government-related, whether it's civil or defense. So certainly government is a huge customer.

**Jeff:** As far as near term market opportunities, we've seen how quickly you know uh SpaceX once they had stabilized their system started to turn on a lot of commercial avenues of that of that capability and it's been interesting that the everyday user now is getting on their mobile phones this access to satellite reliability and people don't understand that the world has cellphone coverage but what percentage of the world does not have cellphone coverage? It's much larger. So when you can put those cell towers in space it changes the dynamic of coverage.  It creates a lot of interesting opportunities for new business. Amazon and Kuiper have been working on a similar network, we know there are companies in Europe that have been working on similar things, I imagine China and Russia are also thinking about like hey how do we have our network that helps us in commercial but also in wartime. Because this has now become a strategic advantage to the communication front. 

What are some of the market opportunities you see that are really hot right now for space?

**Peter:** Yeah I think you've hit the nail on the head, I think commercial comms is a huge opportunity, and I would say look we're right at the very beginning of this. This is a very early execution of the system. I've always said that I think the biggest application in space hasn't even been thought of yet. With this kind of direct device comms and internet from space, it's really been enabled by low-cost access to space. And that's not going away anytime soon and there's more providers of that, including us for example. 

A good analogy to think about it is when the internet was first created - it feels like we've sent our first email. That's where we are in the progression of what you can do in space - 

Jeff: we're at the baby stage of where it's going.

### Space Traffic Management (17:33)

**Jeff**: You know, what's fascinating about that future - and let's get to that - is you know, we can see some of these satellites, right? Like you can see when Elon launched all these new satellites you can see them. And so but the world's a big place - like we have how many hundreds of millions of cars do we have on the planet. I'm curious like, do you see the launch of so many more items having like a crowding problem up there, or is this not a non-issue because the space that the amount of space in space is so big? I'm just curious to ask - it's maybe a dumb question but interested in your input.

**Peter**: No no, totally, it's a good question actually. So yes, space is big, and if you took all the spacecraft that are in orbit, it would probably fit in a football paddock. So there's not that much metal flying around in orbit in the grand scheme of things. 

However, it's also kind of like having a highway with zero rules - as in no traffic lights, no intersections, I don't care if you're going up the road or down the road, cross the road, doesn't matter, just go. And in doubt, when the highway is not busy, then the chances of you t-boning somebody is pretty low. But as the highway gets busier and busier, those chances continue to increase until it becomes inevitable.

So there is going to have to be a global space traffic management thing. We need traffic control in space as well - just like aviation, just like on a set of rules on the motorway. It's just that has to happen.

Now the challenge for everybody is, unfortunately it's a little bit of a human condition to wait until something all turns to crap and then do something about it. And it's not like just the US can put this in place because everybody's going around the planet every 90 minutes. So there's no kind of "well let's stop and detour around China for a moment" - like we are going over China just as we're going over every other country. So all of the countries, the whole globe, has to get together and agree on a set of rules and norms that would enable space traffic management. Then I think it's no problem at all. But until that happens, then we're literally on the highway somewhat blindfolded, flat out.

**Jeff**: Okay, so is that something you're going to tuck into your responsibilities and end-to-end space management, or is there some sort of body that's trying to bring these countries together?

**Peter**: Yeah, because I'm the guy who's going to create a global agreement! In saying that though, I did go to the UN a number of years ago and talked about this, and it was singularly the most inspiring and depressing thing at the same time. Because it was all inspiring that all the countries turned up to talk about this, so clearly everyone recognizes it's a global issue. And everybody read their own pre-prepared statement, and I was kind of like chairing a panel on this, and everybody read their own pre-prepared statement. And at the end of it I'm like, "Right, let's just go and have a whiteboard session and sort this out," and there was deafening silence there.

And I realized that within the UN, there hadn't been a global kind of outer space rule agreed since the 1970s when the Outer Space Treaty was signed. So it's not an area that has been successfully kind of conjoined and agreed on over history.

**Jeff**: It seems like something ripe for conflict if we can contemplate that we're using this for military purposes, we're wanting countries are thinking about it more from a military perspective - not that they haven't used it for intelligence for a long time, but it seems like if there's no rules and we got these strategic assets up there that cost a lot of money and then bumping into each other accidentally or maybe on purpose could be a place that's ripe for conflict without more unification.

**Peter**: Yeah, yeah, and like I say, I think I've sort of resolved myself to waiting until there's a big enough issue that everybody goes, "Okay yeah no, let's we need to talk about this now."

### Vision for the Future (22:19)

**Jeff**: Interesting. Well let's start hearing more about the future. We've talked a little bit about today, some of the challenges, some of the incredible things you're doing to kind of bring this together for companies and for markets. What do you envision as we think 10 to 20 years ahead? You talked about the need for unification for rules - that I would say that's something that sounds really important for 10 to 20 years from now, hopefully sooner. What other things come to mind from your perspective as we project forward?

**Peter**: Well, I think overall, everybody will be - the space layer will be much more connected in everybody's everyday lives. Now already it already is, but most people don't realize it. Whether - I mean, like you order a pizza, the reality is that's come from space now. That sounds a crazy thing to say, but I mean, if it wasn't for the GPS, your pizza would not have turned up at your house.

So there's everyday stuff that we do that is relying on space infrastructure, but it's just hidden infrastructure and it's just not that obvious. Now I think satellite comms has become a little bit more obvious because everybody knows that they're talking to a satellite at least. So that's become a little bit more obvious.

But as that becomes normalized, I think it will just be - we'll look back and go, "I remember those days that you didn't have ubiquitous cell phone reception, remember having to sit on a plane and just like the maximum you could do was an email." All of these things - it's not five or 10 years, this is like 10 months away.

So I think there'll be pretty significant quality of life changes to a lot of folks because of the space infrastructure. And then there will still be all the hidden layers - the weather satellites up there that are providing weather data to provide weather forecasts and all those kinds of things. I've talked about GPS, Earth observation satellites that are providing imagery and things like that that you may not realize but will soon be integrated into so many things.

You know, if you've got real-time imagery from space, then for example you could monitor all the traffic in a city and kind of predetermine traffic jams and all of those kinds of things. So there's a plethora of capability that can be exploited in space that I think will become obvious for some people and it'll just kind of integrate into the global infrastructure and be completely oblivious, but everybody's life is going to improve.

**Jeff**: That's cool to be able to say that everyone's life will be able to improve. I think once you understand connectivity to information and you can tap the world's information no matter where you are - I don't know what percentage of the earth isn't covered by cellular service, but there's a lot of issues that whether you're a deep sea or deep mountains that come with connectivity.

**Peter**: Well, if you look at the world and what is the distinguishing factors between a first world nation and a third world nation, well it's largely education. And if you can take an online Stanford course in a mud hut in Africa, then your quality of life is going to improve. So yeah, having that ubiquitous dissemination of information and knowledge is going to be great.

**Jeff**: It's one thing to have that knowledge available over the internet, it's another thing to have that ubiquitously available on a device that's inexpensive to be able to kind of tap that information.

**Peter**: Yeah, exactly.

### Role of AI in Space (26:00)

**Jeff**: That's fascinating. You know, one of the things that we've been noticing with robotics in particular is how AI has been accelerating that. It's sort of like people get excited about ChatGPT and how AI and deep Agent AI has been really fun to watch this year - how much deeper AI can go around problem solving and produce really valuable analysis. But computer vision has been a game-changer. I mean, it seems like from zero shot being able to communicate a lot of information via computer vision to robots or to cameras in general - the intelligence that you can pull off of a camera these days without doing a lot of training is really fascinating.

And I was curious how AI and computer vision kind of tie into how things are accelerating in space, if there's been a - if you anticipate a lot of innovation as a result of AI and computer vision?

**Peter**: Yeah, totally. I mean, you can kind of bisect that into on the ground kind of doing the creation and then in orbit. So from the in orbit perspective, of course you've got Earth observation satellites - they're taking images and imaging the whole world every day. And if you're imaging the whole world every day, then you can see a lot of stuff, and that is just like the ultimate example for machine learning and AI to be able to build a terabytes of database every day and then just query it.

It's like, "Well, I wonder what happened over here, or are there any changes in the forest today?" "Yeah, there was like 20 people cutting all these trees down this afternoon." Like that - you don't have to go hunting for that, you just - it's just a query of a database. So that becomes very, very powerful.

**Jeff**: So hold on a second, I just want to make sure I capture this, but we can grab this large data set on a daily basis almost as a large language model, and then because we have the AI of today as a conversational interface over that large database, we can query kind of the changes of the world on a real-time basis. Is that synopsis?

**Peter**: Totally. You should have Will from Planet Labs on your show and get and talk to Will about that, because this is exactly what Planet Labs as a company is doing. So yeah no, there's just tremendous power there to see insight for sure.

**Jeff**: Nice. I cut you off though, you had...

**Peter**: Yeah, well so the other part is on the ground. And like when every Electron flies, there's about half a terabyte of data that comes down from each flight. We have like 15,000 channels of data acquisition on that launch vehicle. So that's a lot of data to ingest, and if you were just some poor engineer sat at a desk and trying to compare like, "Well, was that combustion chamber profile of chamber E9 the same as the last 60 flights or was it different?" - you can do that, it just takes a lot of time. But being able to ingest that and just query through AI and then pull some insights out of that - that's just one example for us where we're deploying AI throughout our business, and then in more traditional places in finance and whatnot.

But I think doing the things that we do is going to be made even easier with AI - from coding and well understood there, but I mean even from data reduction analysis and all those kind of things. So I think it's going to have a big impact.

**Jeff**: Yeah, I think the notion of all these sensors getting data and you producing that sizable amount of data - like how you take big data but then turn it into little data that is actually meaningful, right? It's like this is where AI overlaps completely, and then tuning that to make sure you're getting valuable insights so it's not just noise. It takes some work, but that's available today. It's not like this isn't like futuristic technology - this is what we're doing essentially.

**Peter**: Yeah, and we've already employed it in some of those example data sets, and it's just stunning what you can achieve. And what took some engineers days and days and days to do is reduced down to minutes.

**Jeff**: That's amazing. I mean, does Sir Peter look at 30 different monitors up on the screen and he's like analyzing that real time, or do you just get a text showing you the four insights that you need to be aware of because the AI kind of delivered harnessed all of that information that we're looking at?

**Peter**: Right, wow. Unfortunately I'm a geek, so I'm down in the raw data still.

**Jeff**: All good, oh that's fun. I bet it's fun to be in the raw data.

### Future Talent Needs (31:00)

**Jeff**: So that's fascinating. Well, this has been really interesting, and I have a few more questions to kind of close us out. But one was around the people that are going to be in more demand in the future as we think about the space industry accelerating. Those that are interested in getting involved - like you got involved at a young age, which is unique, and it's been part of this journey for a long time. What would you say to them as far as some of the types of engineers or specialists that we'll need in the future? And it could be more of the same, but I wanted to ask.

**Peter**: Well, so firstly, and this just doesn't go with space, I think it goes for anyone starting out in their career - it's like find your passion, right? Because there's going to be highs and man, there's going to be some lows. And in the space industry, you literally work your butt off for months or years for one giant event that either will go spectacularly well or spectacularly bad. So it's a very digital outcome. So you need to be very passionate about what you do.

But I would say, look, one of the areas that we continually struggle for is mechanical engineers, as an example. So look, I'm sure AI will certainly help a mechanical engineer develop various things, but there's a bit of a blurry line, especially in the space industry, between good design - a blurred line between art and engineering or art and science. And the very, very best designs look incredibly simple, but they've probably taken the longest to do because that's just what good design looks like.

So I think that's an area where there's always going to be a huge demand. Software and coding, there's always going to be some really niche stuff there, but as we see over time, the more mundane tasks AI can do a great job of. And maybe it's just me because I'm a mechanical engineer and AI is a boom right now so everybody's in software, but actually, don't forget - you need the hardware to do the software.

**Jeff**: Yeah, I definitely think it's an interesting space. We've seen the tide turn a little bit on the demand on software engineering given the acceleration of AI, also some of the things that have happened in the market dynamics with kind of tech companies. But it seems like hardware has emerged as something that's continue to be important and growing. And sometimes you see ebbs and tides between hardware and software, but it seems like right now we're seeing more of an ebb towards some of the hardware-oriented companies. And that would go back to hey, mechanical, obviously electrical as well, but some of the mechanical engineering fundamentals that underpin good but innovative engineering.

**Peter**: Yeah, exactly right.

### Most Exciting Future Advancements (34:03)

**Jeff**: That's great. Last two questions. One is - what are some of the advancements in space technology that you're personally most excited for? And that could be something you've already said, but I just wanted to ask.

**Peter**: Well, so I'll answer this in a little bit of an odd way. The thing that I'm most excited for doesn't exist. And we've spent a bit of resource trying to figure it out as well as many others. But the biggest limiting factor for any space activity is the fact that somewhere between 1 and 5% of the total mass of the rocket is the actual thing you put into orbit.

So if Earth's gravity was just a little bit higher, we wouldn't get anything to orbit. The atmosphere was a little bit more dense - I mean, for whatever reason, it's just possible. And whoever - if there was some designer of all of this, they'd be sitting back in their chair chuckling away going, "Man, I've just made it real hard for these guys and they're struggling." If Earth's mass was just a little bit less or whatnot, it would be so much easier.

But the reality is we achieved combustion optimum efficiency back in the '60s. So there is no propellant combination that you can put together to make a higher-performing rocket engine. That's it - like hydrogen oxygen, that's your lot. And the trouble is that even with that, it's like 1 to 5% total mass is the thing you put into orbit.

If we truly want to be a space-faring civilization and transit the solar system, man, we've got to find a way better job than burning dinosaurs to get off this planet. We really - like chemical propulsion works, but it just works. So I'm rooting for the antimatter drive, the ion drive, or some other alternative drive.

Nuclear is awesome. I mean, you like - you can get the best you can get from a hydrogen oxygen engine is about 400 seconds of ISP, and ISP is a measure of like performance or efficiency. Nuclear engine, you can get up into the thousands, which is great. It's just a little bit of an issue that you just got a nasty stream of radiation all the way to orbit, which is suboptimal. But in space, it's a great technology. But the hardest thing is getting off the planet.

And until we really crack a different way of propulsion, a different way of providing propulsion, then you end up with comically large rockets to put relatively small amounts of mass into orbit.

**Jeff**: Comically large is an interesting way to look at it, but it rings true. That's fascinating, very deep.

### Most Rewarding Experience (37:14)

**Jeff**: Last question - that is, what's the most kind of rewarding experience that you've had in the industry so far? You've accomplished a lot and a lot more than most people do and in a very kind of end-to-end way. It's impressive. We're excited to keep watching where you go. But you know, people ask me sometimes and I just run a small company of 400 engineers, but like - tell us kind of as you look back, what would you say has been one of the most rewarding experiences or accomplishments?

**Peter**: Oh, that's a really tricky question. That's almost asking me to talk about my feelings, which is equally... so I don't know. I mean, look, the technology and the accomplishments is awesome. I mean, we went to the moon with a mission off Electron, that was amazing. And we've reentered capsules, and there's just been so many technology moments or spacecraft or space moments that have been amazing.

But I guess one of the most satisfying things for me is actually just watching the team grow. And like, I think back to - we were just a bunch of, in many cases, graduate engineers kicking around in a little lab, and those guys now are vice presidents running big parts of the company, responsible for huge things and are amazing people.

And even today, I induct everybody who comes into the company, and it's always really - doing it long enough that I've seen enough really early-stage graduate engineers who - and you can sort of know because they're just full of beans and going to make it happen no matter what. And that's one of the great things about Rocket Lab - you can start as a graduate engineer and end up as a vice president in a relatively short period of time if you kick ass. So that's super fun to watch.

**Jeff**: That's awesome. Yeah, it's one thing on the technology side, but the human side, the people side, and being able to watch people grow through overcoming challenges - really hard challenges - and seeing that grow into a successful business and congrats. You know, proud of what you're doing and excited to watch what you guys accomplish in the future.

It's our pleasure to have you on this show and grateful, Sir Peter Beck, for what you're doing and your passion - we can hear it, can kind of feel it. So congrats again and thank you for coming on.
