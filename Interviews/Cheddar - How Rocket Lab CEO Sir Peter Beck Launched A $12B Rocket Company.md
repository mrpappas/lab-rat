**Interviewer:** World's richest man, SpaceX founder Elon Musk has sucked up all the oxygen in this private space race, helping get Donald Trump reelected and now becoming Trump's de facto VP and BFF. But while the SpaceX owner has loudly commanded the headlines, a competitor is - as quietly as one possibly can - blasting off, successfully launching a suborbital mission in November to test hypersonic technology for the Department of Defense. Sir Peter Beck is the founder and CEO of aerospace company Rocket Lab, and he joins us now from Auckland, New Zealand. 

It is great to have you, sir. Really wonderful reading about the progress your company has made in this short period of time. So take all the time you want with this answer: How on Earth do you build a rocket company, quietly, now worth 11.5 billion dollars, let alone with no college degree nor connections in the space industry?

**Peter Beck:** Well, it's pretty easy in some respects, Dave. It's just all about execution. And you know, the great thing about this industry is there's a lot of visionaries and a lot of noise, as you know. But also, what really matters at the end of the day is just execution. So we've just quietly, as you said, gone about building the business and building capability in the rockets. And you know, as of today, I think we're the third most frequently launched rocket in the world, and continue to grow.

**Interviewer:** Why was this your goal of all the things you could do?

**Peter Beck:** Oh look, I mean, from a very young age there's two things I was very passionate about - one is engineering and one is space. And if you combine those two things together and rise them to the peak, then you end up building rockets for sure. So yeah, look, it's always been a passion.

**Interviewer:** Can you take me back to that moment? What was your first inspiration about space?

**Peter Beck:** Well, actually it's one of my youngest childhood memories. I remember standing outside with my father and he was pointing to the sky and noted that every one of those stars in the sky is like the Sun pretty much, and has planets around them, and there could be somebody staring back at you. And that just kind of scale of the vastness and the unknown was really what captivated me.

### Recent Achievements

**Interviewer:** That's inspiring. So you launched two different rockets from two different hemispheres in one weekend. How significant an accomplishment was that?

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, well, look, launching rockets in quick succession has become somewhat normalized, but I don't think anybody's done it from under 24 hours in two hemispheres, from either side of the planet in short succession. So that was a great milestone. And you know, they were completely unrelated missions. It's just, we've got a bunch of customers and we're busy, and we just had to light up two launch pads and let it go. Just keeping your head down and grinding, I love it.

**Interviewer:** So I see out of the way up, what's next? What's in store on December 18th?

**Peter Beck:** So this is a customer, it's one of our largest constellation customers, a customer out of Japan. And we actually signed a deal with them earlier this year for a 10-launch block buy, and this is just making good on that. So this is a synthetic aperture radar constellation, and we've launched them I think five times already previous to this. So, great customer.

### Customer Base and Business Model

**Interviewer:** Who's your biggest customer?

**Peter Beck:** So our customer base basically bisects into 50% government and 50% commercial. So we do a lot of work for the US government on a number of programs, both national security and civil - so a number of missions for NASA. And then commercial customers range quite frankly from the big blue chip primes, the defense primes that you would expect, right through to - one of my favorites was we launched a little one CubeSat for California Irvine high school students. So really a pretty broad spectrum.

**Interviewer:** It is indeed. And you've arguably blown by giants like Lockheed Martin, even Boeing. What's allowed for that, do you think? And how, big picture, have you done things differently than others?

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, well, I think look, launch is always a thing that everybody gets excited about, right? It's the big fiery stick roaring to the sky. But actually two-thirds of our business is a Space Systems business, which is building satellites and infrastructure in orbit. 

So the one thing that makes Rocket Lab a little bit different is, we've obviously talked a lot about the rockets, but we're an end-to-end space company. So what that means is a customer can come to us and say, "Hey, I want this thing, this communication or this Earth observation thing from orbit," and we're one of the very few companies that can design the satellite, use all the company's own components to build the satellite, and then once it's built, launch on our own rocket, and then once it's in orbit, actually operate it for our customer to just provide data.

So you think about the traditional way you go to space - you have to become an expert in orbital dynamics and build a spacecraft and then procure launch, and then be an expert in operating spacecraft in orbit. Well, we just don't think that's the way of the future. So we've created this kind of end-to-end solution here where we're like the one-stop shop for space.

### Long-Term Vision

**Interviewer:** And what is your ultimate goal here with Rocket Lab?

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, well, if you look at the space industry, you can think about it in three different pillars. So you have launch, which is really critical, and that's about a $10-20 billion TAM. Then you have Space Systems or satellites or the infrastructure - that's $20 to $30 billion TAM. And then you have applications, and that's a $320 billion TAM - applications being all of the things that you do from space.

So for example, all the services that come from space. And ultimately what we're trying to do is position ourselves to provide those services, because obviously that is much larger market opportunity. But it's pretty disruptive when you have the ability to build your own satellite and launch it. The time frame and the cost that you can build those infrastructure plays in is just far shortened, so it becomes very competitive at that point.

**Interviewer:** As inspiring as a rocket launch is and space is, what are those applications you're referencing? So many people wonder why are we spending so much money on space. So practically speaking, what are those things we hope to accomplish?

**Peter Beck:** Look, that's a great question, and I think space is hidden infrastructure. So you know, apart from a little dot might streak across the sky, you really don't see it. But the reality is, we use space in our everyday lives all of the time. If you turn off GPS, your pizza doesn't turn up even. So it's tremendously integrated into everyday lives.

But I think what's been really exciting for me to watch over the last sort of five years or so, five to 10 years, is that a lot of companies that are not natural owners of space infrastructure are becoming that. You think about the Amazon Kuiper constellation to provide internet down on Earth. You think of Apple's satellite-enabled iPhones now - direct-to-mobile communications. Starlink is another great example. I mean, is SpaceX now still a space company, or is it a telecommunications company?

And I think that really proves the power of having the ability to build a satellite and then launch it by yourself. It becomes blurry whether or not you're a space company or a telecommunications company or an application company. And I think honestly that is what all the big space companies of the future are going to look like.

### Space Tourism and Human Spaceflight

**Interviewer:** Interesting. Is space tourism a part of your ultimate model? Do you think there will come a point in time 20, 30, 40, 50, 80 years from now that people could live in space?

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, look, it's not currently part of our current trajectory. In saying that, the Neutron rocket that we're developing right now, which is a medium-class launch vehicle, is human flight capable. But right now, if I look across, there's really one customer, being NASA, and there's one and a half really good providers of human spaceflight in the US. So it's kind of a limited market and a well-served market today.

But I definitely think that in the future, as more things are occurring in low Earth orbit - obviously the space station is predicted to become a commercial kind of venture at some point - then there'll be a lot more destinations and a lot more customers for space tourism. And I think it will become a real market, but right now it's a very constrained market really with one government customer.

**Interviewer:** Yeah. Boeing has had several stumbles in this space. Do you believe they'll exit?

**Peter Beck:** I have no idea. You know, I'm worried about Rocket Lab, worried about our business.

### Stock Performance and Valuation

**Interviewer:** Yeah, and I'm at the New York Stock Exchange, so I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about your stock prices, which has also been a relative rocket ship - more than 300% increase this year alone. Still more room to run? Is this a good time to invest in Rocket Lab?

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, look, I mean I think part of that is, we just quietly execute. And within the space industry, it's fair to say that a number of companies came public and didn't do well. And we just quietly executed, met our numbers, and continue to grow significantly year on year. And the shareholders are getting rewarded for their patience in us in that respect.

But I would say that if we look at SpaceX as our biggest competitor, and they're clearly the leader within the industry, their valuation is somewhere between 250 and $350 billion. Rocket Lab's valuation is less than 4% of that. And as those two companies start to look less and less dissimilar, then I think you would expect valuations to probably track the delta as well.

**Interviewer:** Can you justify anything near a $300 billion valuation for SpaceX?

**Peter Beck:** Well, look, I mean SpaceX is not a public company, so I don't think anybody really knows the numbers in the books. But clearly they've been very successful and continue to raise capital at ever-increasing valuations. And look, they've created a very high value.

And if you think about how many companies have access to space on a frequent basis - right now, obviously SpaceX are the leaders. It goes: SpaceX launches the most amount of rockets to space, then it's China, then it's Rocket Lab, then it's Russia, then it's Europe. So it's a very constrained capability and a very unique and in-demand capability.

### Competition and Political Landscape

**Interviewer:** And regarding SpaceX, how concerned are you about Elon Musk's relationship with President Trump, the possibility that he'll use that influence to box out companies whom SpaceX compete with, namely Rocket Lab?

**Peter Beck:** Not really at all. Look, I think there's enough checks and balances in there, and this is, at the end of the day, democracy. So I don't think there'd be too much tolerance for any funny business by anybody.

And I think the things that Elon stands for are the things that are great for the industry - much more efficiency and much more commercial capture of the opportunities to drive down costs and increase capabilities. These are all the things that we stand for also. So look, I'd be very surprised to see any funny business there for sure.

**Interviewer:** What has Elon meant to the private space race?

**Peter Beck:** Oh, make no mistake, I mean, he has plowed the path. We were at the beginning a few very large primes that really commanded any price, and it was very government-focused, uncommercial industry. So I think SpaceX has really led the way in that respect, and tremendous credit to Elon and the team over there. And look, we're just drafting behind, and hopefully we can be number two.

### Business Advice and Philosophy

**Interviewer:** Pete, I got to take at least a minute, because what you've done is so inspiring, to ask you: Best business advice you either learned from someone or the best business advice you offer to others who are starting a new business, trying to reach a goal similar to what you're doing?

**Peter Beck:** Well, I mean, it's going to sound incredibly elementary, but really make sure that the product you want to build is the product people want. And I know that sounds crazy, but in the space industry, I've seen so many companies where space guys are often technologists, right? So we get all wound up in the technology and develop the coolest thing. And a lot of companies have developed really cool stuff and really cool technology, but nobody cares - like, there's no market for it.

And you often find where people are trying to force technology and kind of create markets as a result of their technology, rather than actually solve problems. And I think that's part of the reason why we've been successful is we're very commercial, and we focus very deeply on where the market opportunities are and go after them just absolutely religiously.

**Interviewer:** Love that. And finally, you've described your mindset as a quote "healthy paranoia." How does that guide you, and what are your thoughts as related to failure?

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, well, I think in this industry, you have to be paranoid about failure because it's like everything's either perfect, or it's international news. So there is no middle outcome here. And as a result, you just have to be over everything all of the time and be very respectful of the energy that you're dealing with and the complexity of the product.

And I think if you take a "she'll be right" kind of attitude to the space industry, you end up on the wrong side of history.

**Interviewer:** Love that. Sir Peter Beck, CEO, founder of aerospace company Rocket Lab in Auckland, New Zealand. Really appreciate the time. Look forward to coming out and catching a launch. The Cheddar team would love to be there for one.

**Peter Beck:** Love to have you. Thank you, sir. Appreciate your time.

**Interviewer:** Pete, see you.
