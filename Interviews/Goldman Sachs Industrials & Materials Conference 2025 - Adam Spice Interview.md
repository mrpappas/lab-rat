## Transcript

### Introduction (0:01)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs):** All right. Hi everybody. My name is Anthony Valentini. I’m the defense tech analyst here at Goldman Sachs. Thank you for joining us. I’m really excited to welcome Adam Spice, the CFO of Rocket Lab. Adam, thank you so much for being here with us today.

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (0:19):** Thanks for having me.

### Neutron Strategy: “No Smoking Hole in the Ground” (0:26)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (0:26):** I think a great place to start is maybe on Neutron. You guys recently announced the time frame for the first launch. Can you talk through the strategy—why it’s a little different than some competitors where you won’t bring a rocket to the pad unless you think it’s going to be 100% successful?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (0:42):** It goes back to: if you’re going to be in this market, there have been too many examples of companies bringing faulty products to market that weren’t ready for prime time. The appetite for mission failure is zero with our customers. It’s the nature of the launch business to a certain extent, but you don’t ever willingly go in knowing you want to take more risk than is prudent.

Pete is a hardcore engineer at his core. He understands the product at a level most other CEOs probably don’t, because he designed and built Electron with his own hands—Electron has now launched, I think, 77 times. With each one, you learn so much and you understand where the risk is in the vehicle.

In developing a new rocket, he’s leveraging everything we learned in Electron to make it as successful. He’s not willing to cut corners to save schedule or cost. People won’t remember a three-month push to a schedule, but they will remember a big smoking hole in the ground. He’s absolutely not willing to take that risk.

### Neutron Timeline & What Has to Happen Next (2:01)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (2:01):** Can you refresh everybody on the current timeline for Neutron for the first launch, and what needs to happen between now and then?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (2:07):** We talked in quite an amount of detail on our conference call about timing. Right now, the goal is to get a vehicle to the pad in Q1, and then launch as quickly thereafter as we can.

To bring a medium-lift launch vehicle to market, there’s tremendous coordination across engines, avionics, tanks, pad infrastructure, and everything else that has to come together. The thing that’s created a bit more of a challenge for Neutron than Electron is the scale.

If you’ve seen pictures recently, there are images of the “Hungry Hippo” fairing making its way through New Zealand. Ultimately, that fairing will be manufactured in the U.S. at our facility just outside Baltimore, but initial prototyping was done in New Zealand because that’s where a lot of our carbon composite expertise resides.

These things are huge—like a 5.5-meter diameter fairing, quite long. Moving parts like that and getting them through qualification is taking longer. With Electron, if you wanted to qualify something or do a tweak, you could pick up an engine with your hands and carry it across the factory. Now, an engine weighs more than a ton—you need cranes and all the different things. And when you’re moving these huge carbon structures, you have to be careful not to put stress on a joint that could take a long time to fix if you break something. We’re being very ginger with all of this.

Plan is: get everything to the pad in Q1. That means the rocket gets stacked and integrated on the pad, which is a little unique—other times it’s done in integration facilities. We’re stacking Neutron on the pad. Then you’re running final tests and getting the final license from the FAA and NASA. We’ve got a pretty well-defined path. Rocket to the pad in Q1; launch as quickly thereafter as final checkouts allow.

### Neutron Spend, Runway, and Cost Context vs. Other Programs (4:41)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (4:41):** What’s been the total cost of the project to date, and every quarter you delay, how much incremental cost should people be expecting?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (4:47):** As we exit 2025, we’ll have spent about $360 million across CapEx and R&D. That’s gotten us a brand-new pad at Wallops, new integration facilities at Wallops, a structures complex outside Baltimore, and it’s got [unclear] test status.

If you target a first half of 2026 launch, there’s probably another $40–$50 million of spend across R&D and CapEx to get us to that first launch. That puts the program at about $400 million total, and it’ll have roughly taken about five years. The original estimate was $250–$300 million over about four years. So we experienced about a one-year push and about $100–$150 million above what we originally anticipated.

But context: Blue Origin had a successful flight of New Glenn a couple weeks ago—very impressive, encouraging for folks also looking to do the reusable ocean-landed architecture. This is anecdotal because Blue is private, but on the order of magnitude: I think it’s 14 years and probably north of $10 billion of investment.

If you look at what it took to bring Vulcan to the pad, that was measured in almost a decade and many billions of dollars—maybe not as much as New Glenn, but that neighborhood is where these programs usually occupy. We’re doing things in half or less the time and for orders of magnitude less in total spending. We’re trying to do aggressive things, and Neutron is no different.

### Demand for Neutron: Government vs. Commercial, and the “Two-Year Wait” (6:48)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (6:48):** I hear from a lot of investors: what are all the things we need to send to space, and how should people think through demand for Neutron? Is it more commercial? More government? How many launches can there be in the future? Let’s put aside the ambition to have your own constellation for a second.

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (7:15):** We’re fortunate: it’s a new and expanding market, and we have a clear comparable peer with an established run rate—Falcon 9 is really the only other medium-lift launch vehicle.

Last year, I believe they launched about 134 times. This year, they were talking about over 190—close to 200. But about 60% of those volumes are estimated to be captive to Starlink. So if you take that and say roughly 90-ish launches of merchant volume, that’s been growing dramatically.

We see a lot of market opportunity for Neutron. The easiest is the government side with NSSL launches, which we’re getting onboarded into. That lane is funded to the tune of about $5.4 billion of earmarked spend between now and the end of 2029. To start tapping that, we need a successful test launch of Neutron—once we have that, task orders can start dropping down to the lane for us to bid on.

On the commercial side, there’s also a lot of demand. For context, the first wave of deployments of Amazon Project Kuiper—which is now called “Project LEO” [unclear]—which we’re not contracted for (to be clear), that’s about 90 launches across three providers over the next several years. Once a constellation like that needs to be reconstituted (LEO satellites don’t stay up as long as prior generations), reconstituting it will take many dozens of launches per year.

You’ve got tangible government opportunity ramping (proliferated architectures like SDA are just now starting to be launched), and then commercial: Project [LEO/Kuiper, unclear], Telesat Lightspeed [unclear transcription], IRIS², etc. Demand is clearly there, and what the market needs is more than one player—right now it doesn’t have much choice.

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (9:57):** There’s a lot of talk about supply constraints. If I’m a satellite manufacturer/operator and I call SpaceX today, how long out until I can get on the pad and get to orbit?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (10:10):** Feedback we’re getting from customers is it’s about two years—when you’re ready to contract a launch on a Falcon 9, it takes about two years, is our understanding.

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (10:23):** Coming back to sizing: it only takes about 10 launches per year for us to get to our target margin model for Neutron—given pricing assumptions and cost for refurb and so forth. So we think the opportunity is much larger than that, but it doesn’t take a disproportionate share of existing volume to hit our marks.

### Margins: Electron Today and Neutron’s Path with Reusability (11:04)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (11:04):** Investors misunderstand how strong margins can be in launch. Can you speak to margins today on Electron, how that improves as volumes ramp, and what Neutron looks like with reusability?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (11:22):** Launch is a high fixed-cost business. Whether you’re launching once or 20 times, you have infrastructure to maintain. For Electron, it’s about $40 million a year to maintain launch facilities and production overhead—excluding variable pieces like labor to build rockets. If you’re launching once a year, it’s horribly unprofitable.

We’ve been consistent: if we get to 24 launches a year (two per month) for Electron, that’s where we hit the sweet spot of overhead absorption and margins—on a non-GAAP basis in the 45–50 point range of gross margins.

Given guidance a few weeks ago (roughly seven launches in Q4), we’re kind of there—we’re knocking on that door. Cadence is super important: you need overhead absorption rolling. ASP has been helpful too—it’s been up and to the right, and we see that continuing given a lack of credible competition in certain segments.

We’ve dialed in production scaling for Electron. Even at 24 launches per year (target margin), we can build twice that—we can build a rocket per week with our existing footprint. Above that level is margin gravy.

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (13:19):** Is that the same framework for Neutron, or different because of reusability?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (13:26):** Neutron’s scale is bigger—production scale, launch pads, everything. Instead of ~$40 million per year standing cost, it’s more like ~$80 million.

Electron’s margin path has been predictable: grow/maintain ASP and get cadence up to absorb overhead. With Neutron being reusable, it’s less about that and more about how quickly we get to reusability. That will drive a more accelerated margin expansion versus Electron, where you build one for every mission.

The power of the fleet model is established—we’ve seen what it can do for SpaceX. You can launch a lot more if you build less. It’s easier to refurbish a rocket than build a rocket.

First Neutron launch is an R&D launch—no revenue. Goal: get to space successfully, re-enter, and do a propulsive soft landing in the ocean. We’re not trying to catch it or land on a barge on that one.

If everything goes really well, the second tail would land on a barge, but that rocket probably won’t be used—we’ll use it for postmortem and dialing in block upgrades. It’s really the third tail onward where you have the opportunity to land on the barge and put it into reuse. That’s where margin expansion starts to show. First couple launches will be negative gross margin propositions, for sure.

### Reuse Assumptions, Turnaround Time, and Fleet Size (15:33)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (15:33):** How should we think about number of reuses, and how many rockets you’d want built and in inventory once you’re at maturity?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (15:46):** Demand-driven ultimately. The rocket was designed to be reusable 20 times.

On turnaround: we’re conservative right now—assuming roughly a quarter to take the vehicle back in, refurb, and get it ready to be reused. I read online estimates for SpaceX are about 29 days to put a booster back into service after launch. That gives a sense of opportunity. Hopefully, we can do even better.

Our original design criteria was: can we put it back in a position where it could be relaunched within 24 hours—not necessarily because demand will drive that cadence, but because the less time you refurb, the less money you spend. So we optimized around efficient reusability.

Target: 20 reuses per Neutron; roughly a quarter turnaround. If you think about 10 launches per year, you could do that with, say, three vehicles.

My assumption is we build out a fleet of around four-ish vehicles over the next couple years. At a “slow” cadence of turning every quarter, you could launch up to ~16 launches per year off that fleet—and more if turnaround gets quicker.

### No “In-Between” Rocket: Why Electron + Neutron Covers the Market (17:41)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (17:41):** Any desire to introduce a rocket between Electron and Neutron?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (17:49):** No—we don’t really see a market for that. Electron can take most satellites that want dedicated launch in the smallsat market. There are some payloads we can’t carry, but if we built a one-ton rocket, we don’t think the market is big enough to justify ROI.

Electron is established, reliable, priced incredibly well for small dedicated launch. Neutron is the constellation deployer and where you take more exquisite satellites into LEO or GEO or beyond.

### Space Systems: Subsystems vs. Full Platforms, Growth, and Margins (18:34)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (18:34):** Let’s shift gears to space systems. People struggle with how to model it—different business lines, products, programs, how big they are, where they can go, and how they ramp.

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (18:51):** Space Systems is roughly two-thirds of our revenue today. People think of us as a launch company—and we are—but we get more revenue from space systems than launch. That may remix with Neutron, but we see a lot of growth opportunity.

Space Systems is roughly two equally sized components:

1. **Subsystems business** (about one-third of total corporate revenue): “Picks and shovels” sold to other satellite manufacturers—solar systems from our SolAero acquisition, reaction wheels/star trackers/sun sensors from our Sinclair acquisition, ground software from ASI (that acquisition), etc. Those businesses are growing around ~20% CAGR, with blended non-GAAP gross margins in the low 40s, but a wide range: solar around ~30 points at the low end, other products north of 70 points. We don’t see that CAGR changing much over the next three to five years. It’s a rising-tide market with diversified customers and products.

2. **Platforms / full systems** (the other half): full platform solutions—complete satellite buses or full satellites including payload. That business is growing even faster and was developed organically (we didn’t acquire a spacecraft platform business; we developed it using acquired technologies and built infrastructure).

We got our first real constellation build opportunity with Globalstar several years ago; we’re wrapping that up. Then we won a bigger program with SDA Tranche 2 Transport Layer. Now we’re in the ring for subsequent SDA opportunities and other government and commercial opportunities. We have a robust pipeline of platform sales.

But it’s important: being a merchant supplier is a nice business, but for us it’s a means to an end. It’s a way for other people to pay for us to develop and scale capabilities that we’ll ultimately use to build our own constellation—our own assets on orbit. That’s the last piece of the end-to-end space vision Pete has been driving.

### Rocket Lab’s Constellation Vision and “End-to-End” Integration (21:38)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (21:38):** Are you starting to think through how much your own constellation could cost, the time frame, and the eventual use case?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (21:49):** We spend a lot of time on constellation opportunities. We’re in an enviable position: launch + selling subsystems means we see what’s working and what’s not. We’re a bit of a canary in the coal mine, not going in blind.

We’re building capabilities so that when we put our own assets on orbit, we can do it in a very vertically integrated way: designing spacecraft, building them with our own subsystems, launching on our own rockets, communicating with our own ground stations—everything.

Application is TBD, but I think of space applications in a few buckets:

* **National security:** hardware sales, services/data, remote sensing/EO models, plus examples where government becomes a consumer of a service (e.g., Starshield). Also missile warning/missile defense (“Golden Dome”-type opportunities).
* **Commercial EO:** hybrid selling into government + commercial customers.
* **Communications:** direct-to-device, Starlink, Amazon’s LEO comms, IoT, future fleet control for autonomous vehicles/drones, etc.

Rather than staking a claim now on one application, we’re building capabilities to stay agile in picking what to exploit—because it requires all the pieces to exploit something the way SpaceX exploited Starlink. It’s not just secret sauce on satellite design; it’s marrying good design with vertically integrated manufacturing and captive launch—prioritizing payloads and deploying at cost and cadence nobody can compete with.

That’s why Neutron is so important: it closes that equation. It’s not everything, but it’s very important to our long-term strategy.

### SDA: Transport vs. Tracking, and Why Vertical Integration Enables Fixed-Price Risk (25:31)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (25:31):** Let’s talk about SDA and what’s next—future tranches, your strategy of starting small and earning a seat at the table, and how that ties to taking on more fixed-price risk.

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (26:02):** SDA’s proliferated warfighter architecture: our first opportunity was Transport Layer. Think of Transport and Tracking: Transport is the communications layer; Tracking is missile warning / missile detection.

Transport has had a lot of chatter around whether government continues to procure hardware or procures a service. That’s very different from Tracking—there is no service provisioning of missile warning/missile detection; that’s government domain.

Our focus has been disproportionately on Tracking vs. Transport. We’re executing on Transport. If future Transport layers get awarded, we’re in a good position due to incumbency.

On Tracking: we acquired an asset in the form of GEOST, an IR sensor payload, and closed that deal (I think in August of this year). Now we go in with vertically integrated bus capabilities plus the payload. We don’t have to cobble together a solution using other people’s payload elements.

This matters for firm fixed-price contracts. What’s bitten everybody in providing space hardware is supply chain flimsiness—fragmented, vulnerable—which is why historically it’s been cost-plus. When you’re vertically integrated (like we are, and like others who will succeed), you can bet on yourself. You’ll take firm fixed-price risk, but you’re not betting on a dozen other people who may not execute on time. As the prime, you take exposure for liquidated damages and such.

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (28:19):** Do you feel the customer is looking for more fixed-price contracts?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (28:24):** Absolutely. That’s all we’re seeing. We don’t play in the cost-plus parts of the market—not that we wouldn’t, but margins are thin. We’d rather take the risk for higher-margin opportunities.

### “Golden Dome” Discussion: Incremental Funding and Timing Uncertainty (28:40)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (28:40):** Perfect segue into Golden Dome. Is the stuff we’re talking about on Tracking and Transport just being repurposed and rebranded, or is the $25 billion people talk about incremental funding?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (28:58):** I think the $25 billion is incremental. I don’t think SDA Transport and Tracking are part of that—those initiatives were taken into scope before Golden Dome was even discussed as a term. So that’s more existing “maintenance of business” budget.

The $25 billion is for new innovative things that weren’t being discussed in a material way before. We now have quite a few points of entry into the government customer: NASA things we’ve done for years, SDA execution, and hypersonics as a big piece of our growing Electron product line (deploying targets for the government to develop hypersonic countermeasures and other capabilities). GEOST adds even more. We’re in a good position to be heard, see what’s coming through the pipeline, and be aggressive in getting pieces that fit.

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (30:28):** There was an expectation the public would know more about the architecture in November, and we’re still waiting. When do you think we’ll understand what it looks like, and when do awards start happening and hitting backlog?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (30:46):** Hard to predict. We’re still pretty fresh out of the government shutdown, so we don’t know whether things were day-to-day pushes or there’s a much bigger delay due to reprioritization. I don’t think we have insight to be that helpful on that one.

### M&A and Capital Allocation: Vertical Integration of the Comms “Signal Chain” (31:06)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (31:06):** You’ve been really successful with your M&A platform. What should people be thinking about from an M&A and capital allocation perspective going forward?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (31:23):** Our pipeline has never been more full and it’s diverse. What I’m most confident you’ll see is continued push toward vertical integration of key capabilities.

A comms platform payload capability is foundational. We’re looking at key pieces of the signal chain: beam-steerable antenna arrays, modems, PAs, encryption boxes—things that let you build a full in-house comms payload. Whether that payload gets pointed at consumer broadband vs. direct-to-device vs. encrypted government comms, you need those table stakes anyway.

Over the next 12–18 months, hopefully a series of those comes into focus.

We do look at needle-moving/transformational deals to enter new markets quickly, but Pete and I are conservative—we don’t do “bet the company” things.

On the constellation side: we get questions like “are you going to buy spectrum,” etc. Answer is probably not—we need to avoid putting the cart before the horse investing in things we ultimately need Neutron to deploy. Incremental lift capacity available for captive use is realistically about three years away. We think customer demand will take the first three years as we scale the vehicle, and only once we get into rapid cadence reusability (10–20–30 launches per year) do you get SpaceX-like internal capacity. So we’re careful with timing and sequencing. Those kinds of deals are less likely, though we continue to look at a lot.

### Closing: What’s Still Misunderstood (33:47)

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (33:47):** Last question: anything you feel is misunderstood about the story or company that you’d like to address with the investment community?

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (34:00):** I think the knowledge base has gotten pretty good. If you looked at our cap table a year ago, it looked dramatically different. We were a lot of retail—we still have a lot of retail—but the institutional investors we had were largely fast money. If you look at our shareholder roster now, it’s an enviable list of quality long-only, strategic-minded investors. That’s encouraging; people are getting educated.

If anything is misunderstood, it’s an underappreciation for the growth we’ll see in international markets. Geopolitics have created less sharing of capabilities. We’re moving from decades of efficient concentrated spend by the U.S. government to a model where many sovereigns have to spend their own money—redundant spend, buying many of the same things in different parts of the world.

Most of the industrial base for those capabilities is in the United States. Even if other regions want to buy within-region, it will take time to develop flight heritage for capabilities. So there will be disproportionate growth opportunities for well-positioned U.S. assets to exploit that.

**Anthony Valentini (Goldman Sachs) (35:27):** Makes sense. We’re up at time. Adam, thank you so much for being here with us today.

**Adam Spice (Rocket Lab CFO) (35:32):** Yeah, thanks for having me. Great.
