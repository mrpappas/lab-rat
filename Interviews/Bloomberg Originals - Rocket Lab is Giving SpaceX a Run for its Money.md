**Peter Beck:** I think I'm the only non-billionaire that's doing this. I mean you've got Jeff [Bezos], [Richard] Branson, you got Elon [Musk], and then me. I mean, how is it that a guy from the bottom of New Zealand that was once coined by Mick Jagger as the "bumhole of the planet" can launch stuff into orbit? How crazy is that?

**Interviewer:** Peter Beck really likes rockets.

**Peter Beck:** Come on, Arthur Valentin Bob Allen liquid rocket engines... it's the sheer challenge of the engineering, the problems you have to solve. This kind of [work] is what gets me going.


**Narrator:** So much so that he started Rocket Lab, a small new space startup often living in the shadow of the bigger companies like SpaceX. But Peter's mission is a little closer to home than Mars. With Rocket Lab, Peter aims to make launching rockets into orbit as common as picking up your mail.

**Peter Beck:** The most important thing that can be done in space right now is to make space the domain that everybody can access. We started on day one with an absolute clean sheet of paper, and you know, we wrote two requirements on that piece of paper: and that was "must be launched really, really frequently" and "must be affordable."

But the most important thing here is getting to orbit like a freight train‚Äîjust get into orbit so frequently that you can use space as a domain to build commercial infrastructure. So that's things like putting internet in space so that every square inch of the planet has internet. And you know, that's truly game-changing for developing countries.


**Narrator:** Peter always knew he'd do this for a living one day, even when his guidance counselor disagreed.

**Peter Beck:** My parents were called into the school. You know, they [the school] believed that my aspirations for a career were totally ridiculous and unachievable, and that I should pursue a trade in plumbing because I was quite good with my hands.

**Narrator:** Peter ignored this advice and instead built this: a rocket bike.

**Peter Beck:** I did about a hundred miles an hour in the nights [with it]. It's an amazing feeling actually. It's an ever-increasing acceleration, so where you point is where you go, and you just hold on.


**Narrator:** Two decades later, Peter has a staff of over 200, and Rocket Lab is five launches away from being in the black.

**Peter Beck:** We successfully completed all our test flights, and we're now into full commercial operations where we're trying to get to one launch a month this year, and then next year we'll try and get to one every two weeks, and then we'll keep doubling down on that.

**Narrator:** Rocket Lab's secret innovation: they were the first to replace aluminum with stronger and lighter materials like carbon fiber, as well as employ radical production techniques like 3D printing.

**Peter Beck:** We've got a factory full of rockets, and we started 3D printing engines when people were making bottle openers and cat prosthetics. Nowadays, if you look at all the startup space companies, they're all printing their rocket engines.


**Peter Beck:** And they have one more little secret: location. The great thing about New Zealand is it's a small island nation in the middle of nowhere. That launch site is the only private orbital launch site in the entire world, and it has more launch availability than America does as a country.

**Peter Beck:** You know, the biggest thing to be done in space is yet to even be thought of because nobody's had access to the domain to be able to experiment and innovate. We're just getting started.

The definition of success for me is to receive a text message from one of my staff saying, "Hope you enjoyed your lunch, Pete. By the way, another one launched, another one on the pad." If we can get to that point where launches are that commonplace, they're uninteresting and that frequent, the world that we all live in is definitely an incredibly different place‚ÄîI certainly hope a better place. It would be a total fail if it's a worse place.
