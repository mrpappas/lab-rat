## Transcript

### Arrival, Badging, and the Facility Aesthetic (0:00)

**Host:** Nice home.
**Peter Beck (0:11):** I’m a little bit more of a fixture here. So, it’s not just an escort [unclear] like—
**Host (0:16):** How are you?
**Peter Beck (0:17):** Good. Good.
**Host (0:18):** I’ll try to get you into the picture so people believe that we are with you. Cool. Congratulations, man. It was beautiful with the water.

**Peter Beck (0:29):** Yeah—we had to… that was one-third of its flow, because if we did full flow, like there’s rivers and it’s just crazy. Yeah.

**Host (0:38):** No, it’s amazing. We got a little bit of drops on the hands and I was like—can we just get everybody a little bit wet? This is so Rocket Lab. You even engineered that.

**Peter Beck (0:47):** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Host (0:52):** Uh yeah… loving the finish. Oh yeah. By the way—by the way, I brought—[unclear]
**Host (1:00):** What’d you say? The [unclear] like that. Did he do that?

**Peter Beck (1:07):** Well—so in behind there is all the structure. So it’s all, you know, big columns and beams. And I think most people just leave it big columns and beams, but we’re like, no—we’ve got a shape and all. And when you go around to the front, you’ll see the exhaust duct—you know, it’s not just square and all. It goes out like that, out like that, and then the front is kind of just chiseled back. So it just looks… It costs no more money to do—like zero more money to do—but it just looks beautiful.

**Host (1:37):** Wow. Beautiful. Beautiful.

**Rocket Lab Staff (1:41):** Pleasure to meet you. Thank you for your service. Are you going to the lab school thing?
**Attendee (1:45):** No. Just want to say goodbye.
**Rocket Lab Staff (1:47):** Thank you. Thanks so much. Holler with anything. Look forward to seeing you soon.
**Attendee (1:53):** Yep. You bet.
**Rocket Lab Staff (1:56):** Let me know what I… [unclear]

### Gifts, “Mars” Tease, and Neutron as the Ride (2:00)

**Host:** Sir Peter Beck—I brought some small things.
**Peter Beck (2:03):** Okay. Okay. Okay.

**Host (2:06):** I brought a small gift for you from Sweden, but it’s back in the base and I don’t know how I can get it to you. Maybe I give it to security, or give it to anybody with a Rocket Lab T-shirt.
**Peter Beck (2:16):** Okay—100% get to me.
**Host (2:18):** Awesome. Awesome. It’s some Swedish candy and jam.
**Peter Beck (2:20):** Yeah. Nice.

**Host (2:23):** Next time, if we come—I found out that apparently in Kiruna there is a spaceport, and they have some alcohol that has elements that have been to space. I didn’t get it. I hope it’s not a scam. I was like, that would be cool to bring.
**Host (2:39):** It’s like when you name a star after yourself. Sorry.
**Peter Beck (2:43):** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Host (2:44):** Did you give us breaking news there? You say we go to Mars.
**Attendee (2:47):** Yeah—what was that? Yeah—what was that?
**Host (2:49):** Well, you mean that satellite? Was that the orbiter?

**Peter Beck (2:51):** Yeah—look, I think it’s no secret that we are pushing hard to make sure that telecommunication orbiter launches on a **Neutron**… and we build a spacecraft. 

**Host (3:04):** I mean, you guys are—for what we know—the strongest contender.
**Peter Beck (3:08):** We hope so. We think so. We think so.
**Host (3:11):** Yeah. We think so too—but we’re biased, and we’re not decision makers in this. And we love it. And I know how much you hate marine assets, but I think we’re going to have to invest in a buoy camp for this, right?
**Peter Beck (3:25):** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don’t you worry—we’re under control. 

### In-House Media, Merch, and Everyone’s Travel Chaos (3:30)

**Host:** Who does your guys’ design? Do you have a media company? Because everything is…
**Peter Beck (3:35):** No—it’s all in-house.
**Host (3:39):** Yeah, but I mean also the video, the filming, the staging… all the investor presentations. Wow.
**Attendee (3:46):** He’s amazing. And that book you guys gave us—all the stuff. Nice to meet you. I’m just one of the lucky.
**Peter Beck (3:54):** Oh, thanks for coming.
**Attendee (3:55):** Whatever.
**Attendee (3:57):** Thank you so much for having us.

**Attendee (3:58):** [He] sent me a mug a while back. I was whining that there wasn’t one in the store, and he’s like, “Hey, I got an extra.”
**Attendee (4:03):** I did—I bought like five of them. They were in stock. I sent one to the UK, and then I sent one to Canada.
**Peter Beck (4:10):** Awesome.

**Attendee (4:14):** Yeah—the retail group is… there’s another guy, Curtis. We hope it’s okay. He also does Rocket Lab merch.
**Attendee (4:24):** He’s very sweet. But I was like, should I wear that today? And I’m like, no, I don’t dare to. Maybe it gets a copyright strike, you know.

**Attendee (4:32):** He got stuck in Chicago.
**Host (4:34):** Oh yeah—he was really badly wanting to come, and then the plane had an issue, and then he was five hours on the landing strip… then it was cancelled, and then there were no other flights.
**Attendee (4:51):** Yeah—that’s why I had to fly into DC and drive down.
**Peter Beck (4:53):** Yeah. My god.
**Attendee (4:54):** He came from Sweden. I came from Denmark.
**Peter Beck (4:56):** Yeah—oh my god.

**Attendee (4:58):** New Zealand doesn’t look so bad.
**Host (5:00):** I’m not—I think New Zealand is worse. I was thinking when I was flying… does Pete also go through—do you fly—please tell me you fly private and you—
**Peter Beck (5:09):** No—you fly commercial.
**Host (5:11):** Oh my god. Really?
**Peter Beck (5:21):** Get a plane, have a glass of wine, do some work, go to sleep, wake up ready to go. Let’s go.
**Host (5:25):** Wow. Okay. Okay.

**Host (5:28):** Well, thank you for all the hard work here. I really—because you appreciate it when we have to travel… it’s not easy with all the…
**Peter Beck (5:37):** Travel very quickly becomes a burden, not a perk—that’s for sure.

**Attendee (5:42):** I’m still waiting for my bag and my flight switched over, and I arrived last night, and I’m like, my bag’s in Colorado.
**Attendee (5:51):** Francisco [got] me a shirt, thankfully. [unclear]

**Host (5:52):** You going to be in Mississippi tomorrow?
**Peter Beck (5:54):** Yeah. Yep. Heading to see us tomorrow.
**Host (5:57):** Can’t wait.
**Attendee (5:58):** That’s where I’m from—Jackson, Mississippi.
**Peter Beck (5:59):** Nice.

### Watching a Launch from New Zealand, and Why LC-1 Is Hard to Visit (6:01)

**Host:** Oh yeah—New Zealand. I want to watch a launch out of New Zealand.
**Peter Beck (6:05):** Yeah—come down to New Zealand.
**Host (6:07):** Yeah—I can make it happen as early as late.
**Peter Beck (6:10):** There you go.

**Host (6:11):** How would that work for investors—could you put a request, like try to watch a launch?
**Peter Beck (6:18):** It’s kind of challenging, because everybody wants to… and you know **LC-1** is not an easy site to have people viewing. You can view from the beach, but to get on the site you have to literally be part of a launch campaign, because it falls under an FAA umbrella of how many people you’re allowed in the hazard safety area and so on.

**Host (6:42):** What’s the best spot to watch a launch in New Zealand—going in there, like in the area?
**Peter Beck (6:47):** I hate to say it, but it’s the live stream. Because you’ll stand miles and miles away in New Zealand—you’ll see a little dot go up into the sky and that’s it. It just disappears.

**Peter Beck (7:00):** Now—this site is the best site to watch a launch. This is actually the closest you can be to a launch in America. The bleachers over there are the closest you can be.

**Host (7:08):** I’ll be here. I will camp out there until you guys do the launch and everything else.
**Peter Beck (7:12):** We’ll be here too. We’ll be here.

**Host (7:14):** A lot of retail investors are from New Zealand and Europe, and they were wondering if you’re doing anything special… because it was only “10…10” that you guys did here for, I guess, restrictions for the US… [unclear]

### Rocket Lab “Nerding Out”: Electron vs Archimedes, Scale, and “This Year” Timing (7:31)

**Host:** You guys have a following. I mean, I met people from different countries—everybody’s from different countries. It’s awesome. It’s strange to be online friends and then meet everybody in person. Really cool. We ended up getting our party after all.

**Attendee (7:48):** Yeah—I mean, we have kids, right? And you don’t have so much time with other friends, and then I was like, “Wow.” I basically spend more time than… really… with my best friends. And then we’re all nerding out about Rocket Lab, but we’re not engineers. Sometimes we’re like, “Do you guys watch the show?” and laugh at our engineering thoughts—like when I think Matt had this idea to put the **Archimedes** engine on an **Electron** rocket. 

**Peter Beck (8:15):** Oh right—you know, that wouldn’t work.
**Attendee (8:16):** Yeah. And I think today he said maybe the Electron can change… so it’s also a methane engine so it’s reusable.
**Peter Beck (8:23):** Yeah—that’s not going to work.

**Host (8:25):** I was also telling them it’s such a cool question to ask, because there’s this saying: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” The Electron is so dialed-in—it’s a machine.

**Peter Beck (8:36):** One **Archimedes** is equivalent to three **Electrons** for thrust. 
**Attendee (8:40):** Wow. Oh my god.

**Attendee (8:42):** On the scale of everything—everything is way bigger than I thought, except for the Archimedes when I saw it, because it is a grunty [unclear].
**Host (8:51):** Yeah—and I was like, so much power out of that little—yep. It looks amazing. That is a little taller than us.

**Host (8:58):** When you watch the hot fire videos, you don’t have a sense of scale, right? I had the idea that you can walk in the engine bell…
**Peter Beck (9:14):** Oh yeah. Yeah. It’s just the one we drag around here—that… [unclear]

**Host (9:19):** By the way—I know everyone’s probably asking: how real is it to still launch this year from—[unclear]
**Peter Beck (9:25):** We will not—we will be here at 11:59 last day of it. Okay? We will do our absolute best.

**Host (9:32):** Yeah—yeah. I mean, we always say in Rocket Lab Weekly: if you look 10 years out, you’re going to launch so much—does it matter if it was Q3, Q4, or Q1? In reality it doesn’t. But you made a commitment, and the team is working so hard.

**Peter Beck (9:52):** The schedule says we can do it, but look—it’s a rocket program, right? You only need one test to go wrong and then you know…
**Host (9:58):** You’re [screwed]. [unclear]

### Wrap-Up: Water Test, Photos, and the “24 Hours” Mantra (10:00)

**Peter Beck:** Well—the water’s working.
**Host (10:02):** Yeah—I showed your water. They should have blasted it. I wouldn’t mind getting wet.
**Peter Beck (10:07):** Yeah—we got to go do a—[unclear]
**Host (10:08):** I got a little bit. You’re going to get—[unclear] Thank you so much.

**Host (10:11):** You want to do a group picture with—
**Attendee (10:15):** Okay. I also—
**Peter Beck (10:18):** Oh yeah. Yeah.

**Attendee (10:20):** Man, that thing looks beautiful—like everything that P does.
**Host (10:24):** That’s the first thing I said: it’s going to be beautiful.
**Attendee (10:28):** Should maybe we should give it—oh, you—he has the camera. Okay.

**Peter Beck (10:31):** One of the mantras for the team is “24 hours.”
**Peter Beck (10:37):** And the reason for that—[unclear]

**Host (10:41):** Congratulations. That was awesome. Were you doing a live?
**Attendee (10:46):** No. No—I was just filming like almost—
**Attendee (10:49):** We… [unclear]
