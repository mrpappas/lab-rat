## üéôÔ∏è Transcript

### Corporate Restructuring and Global Strategy

**Madison:** Thanks so much for having us in, as always my pleasure. Now I've been meaning to say congratulations - Aviation Entrepreneur of the Year!

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, pretty cool. It was a pretty cool event up in Hollywood with all the movie stars and stuff - that was quite fun.

**Madison:** We are going to talk about that, including a certain NASA representative who was there, so I'm keen to ask you if you met them. But let's just start with earnings and this is kind of got to be a mashup of all the relevant items to tick off. First of all, Rocket Lab Corporation - so you're restructuring the company from Rocket Lab USA. Doesn't mean too much for investors, but can you talk us through the thesis as to why a change in parent company structure was required, especially for national security?

**Peter Beck:** It sounds like a bigger deal than it actually is. For national security it's kind of important, but also equally important as we expand into other countries like Europe - it enables us to do the New Zealand wholly-owned subsidiary thing that we've done with Rocket Lab USA. I think it just sets us up for much more global work, and it sounds better - Rocket Lab Corporation sounds way better. As you point out, nothing changes, the ticker doesn't change, nothing. It's just a couple of words on top of a header. It's hardly like a giant restructure or anything like that.

### Supply Chain and Tariff Impact

**Madison:** Obviously you have a vertically integrated supply chain, you make rockets right here behind us, the team is super busy. But I'm keen to understand your supply chain more broadly - my understanding is that you also make reaction wheels in Toronto. So where could and would tariffs impact the supply chain for Rocket Lab?

**Peter Beck:** I think you've hit the nail on the head - we're very, very vertically integrated. In Canada we ship stuff, but we quite often do some transformation of the product, so when the product arrives in America we're still doing work to it. So it's not like a tariff on the full price of the reaction wheel. Within New Zealand, it really only affects us if we're sending stuff up to the states. It really hasn't affected us very much at all. Our supply chain is predominantly US-based.

**Madison:** Although we're sitting in a factory here and there's rockets spitting out - this is a small part of the entire business now with these Electrons they're making behind us. Though these are largely launched in New Zealand and not here, some obviously go to LC-2. But Neutron is entirely launched when it is in play - it will be entirely launched from Virginia but it's made here. Would it make commercial sense to start building that and making that in America?

**Peter Beck:** Well, Neutron is not made here. There are elements of Neutron, bits and pieces made here, but the vast majority of Neutron is assembled in the United States. There are parts of Neutron made in America like Archimedes - all the propulsion system, like 90% of the structures. At our Middle River facility, we have an automated tape layer machine which is a giant awesome machine, and it's automatic tape laying down all of the domes, all of the first stage structures, all the second stage structures. There's a bit of R&D happening down here in New Zealand, but for full production, the vast majority is up in the United States for obvious reasons - it's a big rocket, you're not shipping parts from New Zealand easily.

**Madison:** So insulated from tariffs?

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, yeah, fantastic.

### **[6:56]** Mars Sample Return and NASA's Future

**Madison:** NASA - the Mars sample return is facing some challenges, some uncertainty I guess you could say. It's been killed, has it been? I thought they were just delaying it - have they fully canceled it?

**Peter Beck:** I don't think anybody said they fully canceled it, but if you looked in the president's budget, he had said that we're not looking to do Mars sample return because they plan on sending humans to Mars instead.

**Madison:** I know you have a real soft spot for multiplanetary missions, and not to mention that video was just really epic as well. Does that mean that going to Mars is off the table for Rocket Lab, at least for now by the sounds of it?

**Peter Beck:** Well, not really. Basically anything in space - if space wins, we win. So anything that goes to Mars, the chances are it will have a Rocket Lab logo on it. Now we'll see what happens with Mars sample return because I think that might get a little bit interesting from a political standpoint, because China have made it very clear that they're going to go and get samples. So it'll be interesting to see what happens and if it survives through the president's budget and then it goes through Congress and all the rest of it.

But those samples are bored and cut and sitting on the surface on the planet. A lot of people think they're just dirty rocks, but some of those samples have the keys to biological markers and all sorts of really interesting stuff. I don't see rocks on the surface - I see Nobel prizes sitting on the surface of that planet. I think they will eventually be retrieved, whether it's this administration or another one.

**Madison:** Do you think they should be retrieved before humans eventually get up there? Should that be something that we do as a world before sending humans up to Mars?

**Peter Beck:** I don't think it necessarily needs to be. I think those two things can happen in parallel. I don't think one thing has to happen before the other. But the reality is we absolutely have the capability to go and get those now, and their scientific value will be recognized and exploited now. Boots on Mars is still a very, very challenging thing to do that we think we can do, but of course it hasn't been demonstrated yet.

### New NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman

**Madison:** NASA - they are obviously facing some budget challenges, but they have a new administrator who is an astronaut, has worked in space, incredible guy Jared Isaacman. Have you met him, and because he's there, is NASA back?

**Peter Beck:** Well, I mean that's a good question. Yeah, I obviously met Jared and yeah, great inspiration for NASA. To your point, they are really having to face some budgetary challenges and figure out what they're really going to focus on. So I think that's going to be interesting to see what gets prioritized and what doesn't. It'll be interesting to see how much influence a new administrator can have on that, because at the end of the day, Congress still has a pretty large say in what NASA does and the programs that it executes. But you know, the administrator does have a lot of control and power over that. It's a big job, and I don't think one person just instantly makes NASA back, or if it was even missing.

**Madison:** We've spoken before about how the private space sector has started to win more contracts, and we will talk about defense and exactly what Rocket Lab is winning, especially with HASTE. But there's been this change from what used to be called the primes, right? Do you think that would accelerate now that NASA is being run by someone who has worked in the private space industry?

**Peter Beck:** I think so. I think it has a good possibility to do that. Someone who's experienced commercial and the power of commercial, and someone who is a business leader - those sort of things are going to be front of mind.

### European Market Strategy and Minar Acquisition

**Madison:** Let's talk about Europe. The Minar acquisition still underway, but regardless of whether or not it's successful, fingers crossed it is for you guys, but what do you make of Europe's position in the space race?

**Peter Beck:** Europe is an interesting market, and we've stood back and scratched our heads about how do we tap that market and be successful in it. In order to be successful in it, you have to be basically eligible for European missions and European government missions. The way Europe is set up, they have this geo-return policy - all the countries put money in a big pot at ESA, and then ESA divvies it back out to all the countries. If you're a US firm and you don't have any European company presence, then it's essentially impossible to play in that European government market.

From the acquisition standpoint, we look for technology and people first. We didn't go "we need to find something in Europe." It's people, technology, and it just so happens that it's in Europe, which gives us a nice footing to continue to grow and expand.

**Madison:** Where would you put Europe's position in the space race? It seems to me like they haven't been rapid.

**Peter Beck:** If you talk about commercial, I think you're right. But if you think about Europe, it's essentially the second largest addressable market in the world. It might not be as big as the United States, but it's a really big market, so to not be in there would be a failure.

**Madison:** Did you see the ESA aerospace launch? What do you make of that launch site? I mean, I think you have one of the most beautiful in the world, but that one's pretty incredible.

**Peter Beck:** Come on, it's a second. Yep, it's a second - definitely the second most beautiful launch site in the world for sure.

**Madison:** Is that official?

**Peter Beck:** All right, all right, we'll make that official now.

### **[13:40]** Satellite Market and Constellation Strategy

**Madison:** Let's talk about the satellite market and there are varying numbers out there on the TAM, the total addressable market. I know that in one of your releases a few months ago you put out some research on the satellite space outlook and it said that there were about 10,000 satellites believed to be placed in orbit by 2030, but that didn't include Starlink, it didn't include Russia or China. Talk to me about the size of the market that you see for Rocket Lab in satellites aside from what the mega players already have.

**Peter Beck:** I think that's an important distinction because China is not an addressable market for us, of course, neither is Starlink. You need to correctly divorce that out of the equation. But no doubt - and Europe is another great example - Starlink has proven to be extremely successful, and other countries and other nations want their own sovereign capabilities of that particular solution. Even within the same geographic region, they want multiple solutions. I've said this before - monopolies rarely survive the test of history. So Kuiper is doing a great job now with getting their constellation up and providing competition.

I think we're at the beginning of this constellation growth, but I would say that there's clear data and points in time now where you can go "okay, this is a real thing and it's going to continue to scale."

**Madison:** Can you explicitly outline the long-term game plan for Rocket Lab's place in satellites? You've mentioned Kuiper and Starlink numerous times before - those are telco use cases. Is that what you're heading for, or are there use cases beyond that?

**Peter Beck:** Nice try, by the way. We've been very clear - we're not discussing what our constellation aspirations may be purely because it's way too early. Without Neutron flying at a regular cadence, it's just too early. The secret to these mega constellations is not the satellite - it's the high cadence, low-cost access to space. It's the rocket that is the true needle mover. Lots of people can build satellites at high volume, or few people can build satellites at high volume, but the real hard thing to do is get them into orbit at high cadence.

Neutron is the most important thing, and once we finish Neutron, then that might be the right time to start talking about the next step.

**Madison:** But you have been explicit about the fact that Rocket Lab wants to deploy and operate its own constellation - that's in the plan?

**Peter Beck:** If you look at the market, the satellite services TAM is $320 billion versus $10 billion for launch. It's just the challenge is that launch is the keys to space - if you don't have the keys to space, then you're not going to win. It's not necessarily a massive TAM, but it is the enabler, the single enabler for being really disruptive in that application space.

### Market Sizing Breakdown

**Madison:** If you add on to that TAM then the software like cybersecurity, I've seen you've launched solar panels as well - talk to me about the TAM on top of just the satellites and all of the subsystems and software that Rocket Lab is creating.

**Peter Beck:** **[17:00]** The way we like to think of it is launch is about a $10 billion TAM, then you've got satellites - somewhere between $30-50 billion depending on whose report you read. That's the buses and components and whatnot. Then the applications is like $320 billion. Depending on whose report you want to read, I think Morgan Stanley have it going to $2 trillion and someone else has it going to $1.7 trillion or whatever. Nobody can argue that whether it's $1.7 trillion or $2 trillion, the growth is strong and we're not going to go back from the services that we have now - the services are only going to increase.

**Madison:** From an engineering perspective, how much can you differentiate the design of a satellite? Is it purely a cost game to make them more efficiently at a lower price, or are there actually some design features that you can change up to make them better?

**Peter Beck:** It's definitely design elements. You can definitely design for manufacture and select materials and material processes and all those kinds of things. Neutron is a great example of that with the stage two - we really optimized manufacturing techniques and materials to make a stage two cost tank cost almost nothing. You can optimize that, and the same can be said with satellites. But like anything in production, it's volume - volume makes a difference in everything. So the higher the volume, the lower the price.

## **[18:25]** Production and Manufacturing

**Madison:** Speaking about production volume, the funding that you got under the CHIPS Act and also from the state of New Mexico with Solar Arrow that you acquired in 2022 - the plan there was to increase production of semiconductors to go on satellites. Is that still underway, is that still happening, have you got that funding still?

**Peter Beck:** Still happening, yeah, absolutely. With or without the CHIPS money, we've made a strategic commitment that we're going to continue to grow that capacity, not just out of the goodness of our heart, but we have demand.

### Defense Applications and National Security Focus

**Madison:** I want to talk to you about defense. It's something that we haven't gone too deep on yet, but it seems like this is something that you're more open about unapologetically now. In the most recent earnings you cited an expanding national security focus. It's no secret there's been defense applications and use cases for Rocket Lab, but I wonder what's changed in your mind to be, I guess, unapologetic about it? Is it the state of the world? Are there things that you're concerned about that make you feel like the mission's more critical than ever?

**Peter Beck:** I would say that our national security division and national security projects have continued to grow and grow and grow. I think everybody understands we live in a much more unstable world right now, and national security conversations are dinner time conversations. So it's kind of demystified a little bit from a New Zealand audience perspective. But it's a really important and growing part of our business, and there's plenty going on in the world that points to the importance of national security.

### HASTE Program and Hypersonic Capabilities

**Madison:** We haven't really spoken about HASTE in detail before, so within the defense market I'm keen to talk about its potential. If you consider the contracts you've signed recently - US Air Force, UK Ministry of Defense, first international call up for HASTE - what potential does HASTE alone have, and what unmet need does it provide for the defense market?

**Peter Beck:** The US in particular has fallen behind with respect to hypersonic and hypersonics research. Other countries are fielding systems or supposedly fielding systems, and the US has sort of fallen behind. There's really only one way to get ahead, and that is go and fly and experiment and understand the environment - that's the unique thing that HASTE does.

If you think about it - if you want to go Mach 25, where do you go in the world that can provide a Mach 25 ride on a regular cadence at a low cost point? It's Electron. It provides that test bed capability for all these programs.

**Madison:** I thought that hypersonic was Mach 5 or greater, so you can hit Mach 25? That's 25 times the speed of sound on a HASTE rocket?

**Peter Beck:** Well, when we go orbital we're well in excess of that. Going hypersonic for us is just an everyday thing - we do that every time we go to orbit.

**Madison:** If you look at just HASTE, what is the potential for that to grow now that you've proven your ability to win defense contracts?

**Peter Beck:** There's tremendous need to get this testing done. Could it outstrip orbital class launches? It could be, but only for a period of time as the R&D is done. But we see it as a big market and a big opportunity.

### NSSL Contract and DoD Positioning

**Madison:** **[22:07]** With the NSSL on-ramp with Neutron, we still don't know how many rockets they're necessarily going to buy, and I am keen to talk to you about that. But you've even won a degree of confidence in Neutron and Rocket Lab from the DoD. How would you describe how Rocket Lab is currently positioned in its ability to win defense contracts? Because I think it's worth mentioning that these are inherently hard contracts to win.

**Peter Beck:** Well, don't forget we are a prime provider for the SDA program, which is a half-billion-dollar national security contract. So we're no stranger to being the prime on these very deep technically difficult programs, especially on the spacecraft side. On the launch side, we've flown the Space Force before in many missions, so they know Rocket Lab.

When we had the kickoff meeting just recently and the team were working through Neutron, it's all old friends again, right? So they've worked with us on NRO projects, they've worked with us on Space Force projects - so we're a very known quantity.

But I think it is important because the NSSL are the most important - the highest echelon of missions that you can go for. There are only three other companies that are trusted to launch these missions, and now Rocket Lab as well.

**Madison:** And you're the only public one I believe in that mix?

**Peter Beck:** Yep, yep, incredible.

**Madison:** Do you have any idea as to how many Neutron rockets they could look to purchase? I know that it's an indefinite quantity. Is it reliant on that debut launch going well?

**Peter Beck:** So it's a $5.6 billion contract that runs out until 2029 when the next phase is on-ramped again. Across that $5.6 billion there's a whole bunch of missions and stuff. The first gate onto it is a successful first flight - once we have a successful first flight, then we're eligible for the task orders and we can bid on various projects. So the first flight is an important milestone, but it's not be all and end all.

### **[24:13]** Neutron Development and Engineering Decisions

**Madison:** Let's talk about Neutron. How's the team feeling? How are you feeling?

**Peter Beck:** Well, we're all super excited. It's a fun time of the project where big pieces of hardware are coming together and we're doing big tests. It's also a pretty stressful part of the project as well because now we have, in many cases, flight articles and we're doing the big tests. On earnings you may have seen the full stage one upper module where we've got fairings opening, closing, canards swinging - it's all flight hardware in there with flight actuators and flight software and whatnot. So that goes through a pretty rigorous test campaign.

**Madison:** I might be asking for too much here, but is there any chance you can give us more clarity on the launch window? A month perhaps?

**Peter Beck:** No, that would be completely disingenuous of me because we can plan for a date, but the reality is that we have a lot of big tests to get through. Until we get through those tests, it would just be disingenuous to put a day on it for sure.

**Madison:** I agree, and we wish you all the best of luck. We're all very excited. Can you talk us through the very first launch though? I understand there's no customer payloads on it, so what's a successful first flight for you and the team? Is it just for it to go up, or are you testing some recovery as well?

**Peter Beck:** **[25:17]** The definition of success for us will be we put the second stage in orbit. Maybe that's a little bit lofty because I think there's been one rocket in history that's successfully put their second stage in orbit on first flight - Blue Origin - exactly right, but that was 20 years of R&D and development, not three or four.

We're running exactly the same process as we did with Electron. We're not putting a rocket on the pad or going to fly it until everybody's at least 92% confident that everything's going to work. For flight one, we'll aim for a soft splashdown. If we have a successful soft splashdown, then next one we'll just slip the barge under there and see if we can stick it.

**Madison:** Just slip ROI underneath it exactly?

**Peter Beck:** Exactly.

### Recovery System and Landing Technology

**Madison:** **[26:30]** Let's talk about sticking it, because on paper it doesn't sound too hard, right? You've made this ROI barge, fantastically cool - return on investment. And then you want to land it on it, but imagine there's waves and swell and wind. It's a big stage to come back down and land on it, but if there's some movement on that barge, how does that work?

**Peter Beck:** Well, the barge is not just a piece of steel - I simplify tremendously. There's over a megawatt worth of generators on board that run all these electric thrusters, and it has to station-keep within very high accuracy. There's currents in that particular piece of the ocean, so we're fighting against those currents. The rocket guidance needs a point to come down to, and if that point is moving as well as the rocket's moving, then things get a little bit harder.

So it has tremendous thrust power to station-keep. You've seen the scale of the barge - it's a very large barge, so we don't have to worry too much about heave and roll and those kinds of things. But the barge in itself is a completely autonomous vehicle - it's not just a floating hunk of steel anchored to the ground.

**Madison:** Interesting, so there's engineering built into that as well?

**Peter Beck:** Huge amount of engineering. There is a lot in that barge.

**Madison:** And the stage for it to come back down - does it have legs that stick out and it lands? Talk us through that.

**Peter Beck:** It's fairly traditional in that sense. The one thing that we don't do is an atmospheric braking burn. We've, through the Electron re-entries, developed a technique that avoids having to do that. What that means is you don't have to carry as much propellant, so you really only have a targeting burn and then a landing burn - that's it.

**Madison:** Does that reduce some risk of it blowing up when it lands if there's less propellant in it?

**Peter Beck:** No, you'll land with the same amount of propellant, but you don't have to save as much on the way up. It just makes it more efficient. Every time you want to restart an engine, it's always a bit of a trick and a bit of an event, so the fewer engine starts you have, the better.

If you look at the geometry of the vehicle, it's a very fat vehicle for its payload lift, and we want that really high ballistic coefficient to manage the heating on the way in. This is kind of the difference between a rocket that was appended with reusability and a rocket that was designed from scratch to be reusable.

### Engineering Philosophy and Economic Drivers

**Madison:** **[28:43]** I do want to talk about all of the core engineering decisions that have gone into Neutron. So if you don't mind putting on your chief engineer hat and talking me through all of those core decisions from the hungry hippo fairing and how that's attached to that first stage right down to Archimedes?

**Peter Beck:** I'm always happy to put on my geek hat, but actually I'll put on my economics hat first because that's what drove everything. At the very start of this project, we had very clear targets of the economics we want to meet - like 50% gross margin on this thing. It has to be competitive with what's in the market. That's step one, because if you want to do it over and over again, you have to have the economics right.

This is where a lot of space or more generally rocket companies go wrong - they build cool stuff, and that's great, but the most important thing is if you want to do it over and over again, you have to have the economics right.

So if you start with that point, then you don't want to be throwing away fairings and picking them out of the ocean because that costs money. You don't want to be breaking rockets on the launch site because that costs money. You want to land with your first stage as intact as possible with the least amount of work to be done on it before you have to launch again.

That comes down to managing thermal load so you don't have a whole bunch of stuff to replace because it's got hot. From a propulsion perspective, you can't have time to clean soot out of engines and all the rest of it, so you end up with the methane-oxygen propellant combination so you don't have any sooting in your engine. Then you need an engine that's reusable over and over and over again, so that drives you to a very benign design point of the engine - so the engine's not sitting there like a grenade completely stressed out, it's sitting there with a lot of margin in it. So that drives you to a closed cycle because you get much higher ISP.

All of these decisions run all the way back up to the economics decision about how do you do this economically. It's not just anchored with me - so you go and talk to any engineer working on Neutron, and as they're designing a component, they're thinking about how much it's going to cost to make, how they're going to produce it in any kind of volume. It sounds simple, but in a lot of companies that bit comes way down the chain - it's like complete design for perfect function and all the rest of it, and then we'll worry about how much it costs and how to machine it later. Whereas all the engineers over there - that is like they're trading those things of equal importance with reliability and cost.

**Madison:** This kind of goes back to the very first question, right? The structure of the company, and I guess that is part and parcel of the success of a company like this. You could say about SpaceX too - about the chief engineer also being the CEO and having an executive position, so the money goes hand in hand with the engineering decisions.

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, and also we've always never been flooded with cash, which I never want to be flooded with cash because I think that drives the wrong culture and the wrong engineering decisions. Teams that are lean and hungry ultimately produce better results. If you're fat and lazy, then that's what your designs look like.

**Madison:** Ernest Rutherford - "We don't have money, so we have to think."

**Peter Beck:** Exactly right, exactly. Big fan of him.

### **[32:08]** Market Competition and Ride Share

**Madison:** If we can then go back to the market for Neutron, and this is a question I've been meaning to ask you for a while, but I feel like it's prevalent now that we're getting to the really pointy end, excuse the pun, of Neutron launching. You've made it very quickly, you've developed this rocket in record time at a record low cost, but the market has obviously shifted throughout this time as well. Ride share is now in play. How do you view ride share on heavy lift rockets potentially being a risk for a medium lift rocket like Neutron? Or are you seeing enough demand in the market, perhaps probably from the defense market, for enough customers specifically wanting their own rocket to fly on?

**Peter Beck:** It's a good question, but I honestly don't see it any different to the argument between ride share on a medium class rocket and ride share on Electron. It's the same thing - people want the same order parameters and the same results.

Look, I'm sure that super heavy launch may rob some customers out of medium lift, but of all the things I worry about at night, that is just not one of them. "Are there going to be enough satellites for us to launch?" is just way down here on the worry list. Capacity and cadence are the two things that all our customers and the whole industry is constrained by.

**Madison:** Do you see the space industry, specifically launch, moving to like a cost per kg type model, similar to how in tech there's like cost of compute?

**Peter Beck:** **[33:26]** It's a stupid model. Absolutely stupid. It might work for them, but from a rocket perspective, because nobody actually buys cost per kilogram. If you go and buy an Electron rocket and your satellite is 100 kg and it can lift 320, we don't give you back the 220 kg of extra capacity because you bought the whole rocket. It's the same in any launch vehicle - just because you don't use the capacity doesn't mean you pay less. It's a fixed price thing.

Cost per kilogram is a very tidy metric for finance-type people to rate one rocket against another and all the rest of it, but the reality is nobody has ever bought a rocket on a cost per kilogram basis.

**Madison:** Fascinating. Thank you so much for your time, always good to chat.

**Peter Beck:** Likewise.
