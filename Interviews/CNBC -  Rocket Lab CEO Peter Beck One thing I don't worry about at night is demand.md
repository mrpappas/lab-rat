## Transcript

### Introduction and Recent Milestones (0:00)

**Host:** Welcome back. Check out Rocket Lab up nearly 100% in the last three months. Part of a bigger space trade. Rocket Lab also getting added into the Russell 1000 Friday after the close, the company achieving a big technical milestone this weekend as well, completing two launches from the same site in less than 48 hours. That was a record turnaround. Joining me now, Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder, chair and CEO. Peter, it's great to have you back on the show. Welcome.

**Peter Beck:** Great. Great to talk to you, Morgan.

### Record Launch Turnaround and Production Cadence (0:33)

**Host:** Let's start right there with this fast turnaround you did with these launches over the weekend, and how it speaks to how quickly you're ramping the cadence of your launches.

**Peter Beck:** Yeah. Well, I mean, there's a rocket rolls off the production line here every 15 days or thereabouts. And it was good to get a couple vehicles one after the other. Of course, you know, we've done ten launches this year so far. So, you know it's been a big step up in cadence so far this year. And we look forward to seeing that continue throughout the year.

### Market Demand and Competition Landscape (0:59)

**Host:** How does that speak to what you're seeing in terms of demand for launches? I mean, case in point, whether it's commercial players or governments, everyone I speak to says they need more competition in the market. Case in point, this very public spat between Elon Musk and President Trump really highlighting how dependent overall the market is on SpaceX.

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, I worry about a lot of things at night, but that's probably not one of them is demand. And you know for Electron and little rocket, we've seen, you know, increased demand over the last couple of years. And we're not just launching, you know, single spacecraft. These are generally entire constellations for customers. And then of course, you hit on the point with Neutron is there's kind of a pseudo monopoly in that medium class lift right now. So Neutron is aimed to, to kind of break open that, that monopoly. So yeah a lot, lot of lot of demand. And you know the demand is one thing, but reliably delivering over and over again is equally as important.

### Neutron Launch Timeline (1:58)

**Host:** So when does Neutron fly?

**Peter Beck:** Well, we're trying to get on the pad and launch this year. So it's an aggressive timeline, but we're giving it our best shot.

### Recent Acquisitions and Portfolio Expansion (2:07)

**Host:** You also recently made an acquisition ghost. Are you still acquisitive? How does that expand your portfolio?

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, absolutely. I mean in fact we've made two recently. So one was a company in Germany that's under under way at the moment. And then of course, as you mentioned, Ghost and Joe's really is our first foray into into payloads. So, you know, we're very well known at building rockets and building spacecraft, but now we actually build the payloads to provide, excuse me, a real end to end service for our for our customers and a and a, you know, a stronger foothold in national security.

### Defense Spending and Market Opportunities (2:43)

**Host:** I was just talking about it before the break, the fact that defense spending is growing here in the U.S, but internationally as well. And we're seeing spending on things like SpaceX in particular, whether it's from a national security standpoint or even a civil space standpoint, those those dollars are increasing, too. Where do you see the biggest opportunities and how much of that is domestic versus international?

**Peter Beck:** Yeah. So I mean, generally our backlog looks something like 50% commercial, 50% government. And it kind of ebbs and flows between the two. But I would say that, you know, in a more unstable world, there's definitely more, you know, more necessity for some space assets. So we see national security being a bigger part of our portfolio. But but never the less we like to hold that healthy mix of commercial and government
