## Transcript

### Opening and Q3 Performance (0:05)

**CHARLES:** FOLKS, **ROCKET LAB's** results out last night and let's just say the crowd went wild. Beats across-the-board, you know, we saw once again, couldn't keep up, solid guidance, they beat the street everywhere, and of course, the stock opened up the session much higher. I want to bring in **Rocket Lab's** CEO, **Peter Beck**, and first and foremost, congratulations.

**Peter Beck (0:27):** Thanks **CHARLES**.

**CHARLES (0:28):** What stands out most to you with respect to the last three months?

**Peter Beck (0:33):** Yeah, look, really just the **growth** in the company and all of the business units. And small launch vehicle just continued to hit larger and larger strides and goals, so just really solid growth throughout the business across it.

### Electron, Photon, and HASTE Program Updates (0:48)

**CHARLES:** Let's talk about the business and start with **Electron** and go back there. Your backlog is building, the success is there. What are you anticipating for next year?

**Peter Beck (1:00):** Yeah, look. **Electron** as you point out is the vehicle right now and in one quarter we booked 17 launches alone, so really strong growth in the backlog and yeah, look, this year, we're on track to have the **biggest launch year ever** and next year is shaping up to be even bigger, so super exciting.

**CHARLES (1:22):** Tell us about **Photon**.

**Peter Beck (1:25):** Yeah, so we've got a couple of really interesting missions happening. So a couple of spacecraft sitting on a **Blue Origin** vehicle that we built that are getting ready to launch in the next couple of days to go to **Mars** and the core thing about that mission is when you talk about going to **Mars**, you think of billions of dollars and decades. This was **tens of millions of dollars** in a few years, two spacecraft were built and on their way to **Mars** shortly.

**CHARLES (1:52):** **Elon** last night talking about robots going to Mars too. You talk to Elon yet?

**Peter Beck (1:59):** I've got bigger jobs to focus on myself.

**CHARLES (2:04):** Let's talk about **HASTE** then, another project everyone is excited about.

**Peter Beck (2:08):** Yeah. So, **HASTE** is a **suborbital variant of the Electron vehicle** and, you know, the U.S. has struggled to make great advancements in **hypersonics** in part due to the availability of affordable test platforms, so by taking our **Electron**, we're able to put all these hypersonic experiments on the nose and really accelerate that testing and we're seeing a lot of growth in that market and it's just been tremendous for our customers to develop the technology.

**CHARLES (2:39):** The hypersonic issue is something we've been worried about here particularly with Russia and now they have, unfortunately with this war, they have been able to experiment even more in real time, something we have to catch up on.

### The Neutron "Game Changer" and Development Timeline (2:53)

**CHARLES:** But let's talk about what everyone wants to talk about so I had an analyst yesterday that loves your stock and said maybe **Neutron** will be pushed out but he says this is it. Talk to the folks watching at home why this is the **game changer**.

**Peter Beck (3:08):** You know, **Neutron** is important for a couple of reasons. One, you know, it's really a breaking of the mold of kind of a pseudo-monopoly for the **Falcon 9** vehicle in the market so there isn't anything competing to competitive to that vehicle, so it offers all of their government and commercial customers, you know, a different avenue to get to orbit so that's important. But equally well, it also provides us as a company **multi-ton lift capability** for our own stuff, so you know, we've made no secret of the fact that eventually, our intention here is to deploy our own constellation so having a **multi-ton capability, high-cadence launch vehicle is a game changer** for sure.

**CHARLES (3:52):** There was anticipation that the launch is a big move from fourth quarter this year to first quarter next year. How comfortable you were saying that's certainly going to happen?

**Peter Beck (4:02):** Well look. It's a **rocket program**, right? And one of the reasons why we shifted that a little bit is we have a method for developing this stuff and that method has proven to be extremely good and reliable. And if we think about it, like the reality is in the world today there's been two commercial companies that have brought a launch vehicle to market and made it reliable and scaled into any kind of cadence, and it's **SpaceX** and **Rocket Lab**. And we aren't going to deviate from our path that's proven to develop technology reliably, and look, nobody remembers a rocket that took a little bit longer to get to the launch pad and launch of successfully. Everybody remembers the rocket that **blows up the launch pad**, so just interested in being in that.

### Total Addressable Market (TAM) and Final Thoughts (4:47)

**CHARLES:** I got you, you point that out very often on your website. Before I let you go we're trying to think of where all of this goes. Can you quantify the **Total Addressable Market (TAM)** for this? It just feels like there's so many opportunities for you.

**Peter Beck (5:01):** Look, there really is. The opportunities in space right now are just massive as you point out, and really, you know, if I had to sit down on a couch with a glass of wine; it's really **A.I. and space**, the two big opportunities for humanity as we step forward.

**CHARLES (5:17):** **Peter**, congratulations man, you were ahead of the curve and have done extraordinarily well and could have owned this stock a little more than a year ago for $5.50.
