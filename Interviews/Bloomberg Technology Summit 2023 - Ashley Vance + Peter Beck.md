## üéôÔ∏è Transcript

### Introduction

**Moderator:** PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE, ROCKET LAB CEO PETER BECK, WITH BLOOMBERG'S ASHLEE VANCE.

**Ashlee Vance:** Hello. Thank you, Peter for joining us. It's sort of a victory of sorts for me. A few years ago I wrote a book about Elon Musk and he didn't talk to me for a long time after I wrote the book. I have just written a book about you, and here you are still talking to me. That was too nice.

**Peter Beck:** I like that you spent so much time with me and never figured me out.

*[Applause]*

### Understanding Rocket Lab's Success

**Ashlee Vance:** I tried. Maybe we'll figure you out today. While I was doing this book, I researched, spent five years on it hanging out with you and a number of space startups around the world, I dug into the history of the field as well. If you look over the last 20 years, that has been probably about 12 legitimate rocket startups of some kind. SpaceX is launching about every three days. You guys have launched dozens of rockets, you are up to about twice a week, if you want to. After that, the number goes off quickly. Some people have done one or two and then really at fits and starts. I mean, it's amazing, because there are veterans of space programs at these other companies. What is it that you and SpaceX seem to have figured out that the entire rest of the industry can't seem to get?

**Peter Beck:** That is a difficult question. In the simplest form, it's execution. We don't tend to make a big fanfare. We are at the bottom of the radar and we just keep launching rockets and executing. The great thing about the space industry is also the curse of the space industry. The great thing about it is I can sit on the stage and say, "Ashlee I will go to Mars or go to Jupiter 2030." Randy will go, "Yup, cool." No other industry can you say such crazy things and get people rallying behind you. That is a great thing about the space industry, it promotes big dreams and mid execution. The challenge with it is the space industry has been pretty historically shy in execution. You can say those things and everybody will not laugh you out of the room, but at the end of the day, there is a big gap between those things being said, and execution.

**Ashlee Vance:** You and Rocket Lab and SpaceX, you can say execution, but it is amazing to watch people who have done this before still struggle. The one hand it is rocket science, we know that this is hard. On the other hand, Rocket Lab was a group of twentysomethings that really had never built a rocket before, you didn't go to college for this and you were designing dishwashers at one point.

**Peter Beck:** Remarkably similar, though.

**Ashlee Vance:** [Laughs] You guys have clearly figured something out that got it right. It is still a mystery to me.

**Peter Beck:** I think it is building the right team, setting the right vision and building the right business around it, being kind of very deliberate about how you build your company. As well as building a rocket. At the end of the day, I have generally found that if you say to somebody, -- we have a motto at Rocket Lab, do what you want to do. Generally if you say that you will do something and you do it, it builds good trust. And if you continue to do that all the way through, the new building the company.

### Managing Global Operations

**Ashlee Vance:** Since I have known you, you are an engineer at heart, very hands-on, you build a lot of -- New Zealand is where the company was started. You are building a rocket from the United States, you are the only commercial rocket company that I can think of that is spread across two continents. You are this very hands-on guy. I just wonder how you are evolving now that your attention is geographically split.

**Peter Beck:** It's a good challenge. We have acquired four different companies. It's a huge amount of work. But I think that as long as the thesis and the rules are there and people follow the rules, and I mean the culture of the company, you don't necessarily need to be that guy that screws the rocket engine to the back of the launch vehicle, provided the guy who is actually screwing the rocket engine to the back of the launch vehicle understands the company thesis and all the cultural aspects to make sure it actually works. So it is definitely challenging. I have spent more time on a plane than ever. But it's fun. We talk a lot about rockets. Two thirds of our business is building the spacecraft. Still eager to do some really close stuff. -- I still get to do some really cool stuff.

### The Future of Commercial Space

**Ashlee Vance:** I think about commercial space right now, we have a lot of rocket companies. The cost of launches has come down and we are launching more often, we have a myriad more satellite companies putting up giant constellations. It reminds me so much of 1996 from consumer internet companies, companies delaying fiber, building data centers and saying something incredible was going to happen on the internet. I feel like some things were obvious that there would be businesses that would work on the internet, we just didn't know where this would go. In space, the first big message so far has been communication satellites and imaging satellites. That is the entire premise of what this is hanging onto a large degree. I am so curious about, do you see that as being enough for the next 10 or 15 years? Do you think something has to come along?

**Peter Beck:** I think about this a lot because there is always the promise of the industry and market studies that predict, depending on which market study, you can pick up between $1 trillion or $2 trillion, how large the market will be in 2030. But some of the key factors for me that are more important than ever, you are seeing real fundamental use cases from really large companies. Obviously, Elon has Starlink and that is proving its worth. Amazon has their own company which is the equivalent. We are seeing Apple with the service voyage into space. There is enough room use cases from real companies that it a bit obvious now that it will further liberate.

**Ashlee Vance:** But all of that stuff is really communications at its core. For now, we went from 2500 satellites three years ago, to about 10,000 today. We have been on this suddenly exponential curve after it had been like this for 50 years. A huge chunk of that is communication satellites. I just always think I could see it in the near term, but does that stuff make money? And then what comes next? Otherwise the air starts to come out of the room pretty quick.

**Peter Beck:** That is fair. In the last, I would say 10 years, you have seen a tremendous amount venture capital flow into various space business model's and some have been pretty successful and others, not so successful. But with any new frontier, there is a certain amount of throwing mud at the wall and seeing what sticks. Now you have Amazon building hugely large constellation of service customers. You can loosely characteristic as comms, but Amazon has a purpose, it's not just to sell internet to people, it improves their business model. So in space, people often develop cool stuff and try to find a market for. Their version of that is happening where people actually have business needs at scale that drive putting infrastructure. The U.S. government is the same. The whole "move away from one or two big stationary assets" it just changes the game.

### Beyond Communications: Manufacturing in Space

**Ashlee Vance:** Some people beyond communications talk about manufacturing. You just did a really interesting thing where you partnered with this company, Varda, which is making a pharmaceutical factory in orbit. It went on the SpaceX rocket. Three commercial space companies, two of which are quasi-competitors. The idea that you can make chemicals and molecules in space different from Earth, there is talk about moving data centers up into orbit and reducing pollution on Earth, just having them be solar powered. To do any of these applications jump out to you as the most likely?

**Peter Beck:** I am not so sure that launching the data centers into orbit is better for the environment than keeping them on the ground, but, that company, there is physics and chemistry. If you are in a zero gravity environment, crystal proteins grow differently. That is unchecking that production process from gravity, it is pretty great in changing. It has only been until now that you could do that as a start up at any level of scale. Prior to, even 10 years ago, you just wouldn't do that.

**Ashlee Vance:** $100 million just to try.

**Peter Beck:** Yeah. For tens of millions of dollars, you can have a crack at a really big thing.

### Public Perception vs. Reality

**Ashlee Vance:** If we could just put up a slide where we polled the audience. I found this fascinating. Not trying to hawk my book but I wrote a book that is opposite of this poll. To me, the most activity, the most money is not tourism, it's not Mars, it is in the low Earth orbit where satellites are increasing exponentially. So I am just curious, this is in our lifetime to make the most progress.

**Peter Beck:** I think you should send that to me, maybe I should get working on the Neutron capsule, because clearly I am missing a trick.

*[Laughter]*

**Ashlee Vance:** But you have never been interested as far as I know, in human space travel.

**Peter Beck:** No, that is -- in human space travel? I admire astronauts. I have all the knowledge but not the courage. To be able to sit on rocket and dislocate yourself from all the risk, it is a special superpower to be able to do that.

**Ashlee Vance:** Where do you make of that, that the public thinks tourism is where this is heading, as opposed to industry and business?

**Peter Beck:** It's a masterful piece of marketing from Virgin Galactic.

*[Laughter]*

More seriously, more people like the idea of going into space. Human spaceflight has always been the draw card. It is an entirely different thing to watch a rocket going up with a human on board. It's always in magnitude different and that is kind of the draw. Not surprising that everybody wants to have their trip.

### Competition with SpaceX

**Ashlee Vance:** Historically you and SpaceX have been different. SpaceX makes large rockets, you make smaller rockets. Moving forward you're making this rocket called Neutron that will compete directly with SpaceX's Falcon 9. At the same time SpaceX is making an even larger rocket called Starship. Dealing with Elon and competing with Elon comes with its challenges. I am just very curious if you see SpaceX moving forward now as your most direct competitor and how you keep pace with this company that seems to have a head start.

**Peter Beck:** In some respects, a lot of people want to play that card. But we are on our own journey. At the end of the day, everybody focuses on the rocket like if it is this exciting to read stick in the sky. I am trying to build a long-lasting and durable space company. Space companies of the future are going to have their own rocket, they'll be able to build their own satellite and they will have a series of applications for infrastructure in orbit. That is the endgame here. If you have a rocket can build your own spacecraft, then you can do things in orbit that nobody else can do. In that sense, SpaceX has focused on going to space and moving quickly to prove that the business model will be successful or not, but ultimately there will be a number of those and the companies that can go to orbit at will are the ones who will win.

### The Future Space Industry Landscape

**Ashlee Vance:** I know you get asked this a lot and I am just curious, we have just seen Virgin Orbit go bust, you bought a number of their parts. Historically we have only had rocket companies and satellite companies. You have been in software, you are talking about something bigger than that. How many players are there like that?

**Peter Beck:** Today or in the future?

**Ashlee Vance:** In the future, if you buy into this massive increase in satellites to all of it.

**Peter Beck:** Hopefully there will be two.

**Ashlee Vance:** Do you think it is a two company race? Or more than that?

**Peter Beck:** There will be more than that. I don't think it would be 10. It will be relatively small. The reality is that launching a rocket and building a rocket and going to orbit is an assault on physics. It is really difficult to do. It doesn't really matter, you can have better computing, better AI, at the end of the day, it is 1.1 to 1.2 times safety factor or merging on every single thing in the vehicle. If you look at a rocket engine, the combustion efficiency of a rocket engine has not really changed since 1952. The actual combustion efficiency hasn't changed, we just increased the pressure. We kind of maxed out on the physics and materials a long time ago, so most of the stuff you see is tweaks around the edges. Or in Elon's scale, you just build bigger and bigger rockets. It's fundamentally always going to be super, super difficult to do.

### Conclusion

**Ashlee Vance:** We are just about out of time. What is your next launch, and when is it, and what will you guys be doing?

**Peter Beck:** You know what, I don't know. And that is the definition of success, that I don't know.

**Ashlee Vance:** You are right to some degree. It used to be this all or nothing thing.

*[Laughter]*

**Peter Beck:** We are launching every couple of weeks in general, so probably the next couple of weeks there will be a launch vehicle.

**Ashlee Vance:** Don't know if he is telling us the truth that he doesn't know or if this is an indication of how far this business has come. Thank you so much for your time.

*[Applause]*

**Peter Beck:** Thank you.
