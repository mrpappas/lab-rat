## Transcript
### Host Intro and Opening Remarks (0:20)

**Host:** By the way, that’s not SpaceX.
**Host:** In fact, my next guest is becoming a legend among individual investors, and he reminds me of Alex Karp of Palantir a few years ago — and here is this one post that says it all, Peter Beck is a *bleep* legend. During the LC-3 grand opening countdown water started gushing from the launchpad (you just saw that). It feels like a response to a short report from a few months ago claiming Neutron would be delayed due to water shortages.
**Host:** I want to bring now Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck, and you got the sunglasses on — look at that!
**[Laughter]**

Peter Beck: Hey Charlie how's it goin

**Host:** It’s going great for you. You are doing better I gotta tell ya. So the earnings report came out, and your social media — I can’t believe how many people love your company, and they love you. They talk about Neutron being the greatest medium launch vehicle ever flown. You build up a huge, huge following. Explain how you pull this off.

**Peter Beck (1:20):** We are tremendously lucky, but honestly, we're just head down doing our jobs, and at Rocket Lab it’s all about execution. And as long as you execute everything else follows, the team is working super hard and we’re just getting stuff done.

### Vision, Facilities, and Momentum (1:32)

**Host:** It’s also about vision. I read you are in the U.S. and went to Australia and you have this epiphany. I think one of your seed investors was named Rocket which I thought was kinda strange. Fast-forward to today: you got this launch complex in Virginia, Governor Youngkin was there, this is a huge deal.

**Peter Beck (1:51):** It is. The opening of this launch complex is one of the last big milestones of the Neutron project, we're going to have a rocket on the pad here shortly there's going to be a new small and medium-class launch vehicle in town, so it’s going to be great.

### Neutron vs. Electron and What It Means (2:08)

**Host:** Talk about Neutron. Your first rockets were the Electrons — this is Neutron. What is the difference? What does it mean for you, what does it mean for shareholders?

**Peter Beck (2:19):** Yeah so Neutron is our medium class lift. So what that means is sort of like 13 tons, or 26,000 pounds, of lift capacity. And if you look at medium class lift right now, it’s dominated by our friends over at SpaceX — so [Neutron] really provides an alternative to both our commercial customers and national security customers for the medium-class launch.

### Launch Timing Expectations (2:40)

**Host:** And of course to be clear, the launch will happen this year — by the end of this year.

**Peter Beck (2:45):** Yeah we're trying super hard, yep. It’s a launch program at the end of the day so there's thing in your control and out of your control. Our intention is to get a vehicle on the pad and away this year, and if not, it'll be shortly thereafter.

### Competitive Context and Market Dynamics (3:00)

**Host:** You mentioned SpaceX. There’s a lot of controversy involving [Elon] and President Trump not long ago. There was a thought that Rocket Lab would make gains because of it. Have you seen some gains at their expense?

**Peter Beck (3:12):** Well It’s hard to tell. Look we really just focus on execution and if we do our job right there In then the contracts seem to flow. 

### Growth Pace and Execution (3:26)

**Host:** I wanna talk about that, we are going to bring up the table because you have laid out and you kinda alluded to it already with respect to having a vision, having disciplined execution, the success rate, and the growth pace. The growth pace, I think, is what really has shocked a lot of people. This is a huge curve here and looks like a rocket taking off. Can you keep up this pace?

**Peter Beck (3:46):** Yeah we're not here to mess around Charles, we're here to get stuff done. We are looking forward to continuing that growth, the Neutron project is an important part of it but man we’ve got so much going on in space systems and other divisions, we just acquired another company, and just keep on growing.

### Message to Supporters and Closing (4:00)

**Host:** What do you say to your fans out there? You have so many people, i posted earlier you were gonna be on the show, people love you. I’m going to tell you right now: I bought your stock on my own account at six-something, I sold it a couple of weeks ago at 54, 700 bagger right, 700% percent move. I wanted to buy it under 40 and it won’t go down. So you’ve made people a lot of money, but there's something else endearing about you and your company. Maybe because it’s a small name going against the big boys. What do you say to your fans out there who really truly love you and believe in your company?

**Peter Beck (4:37):** Well a huge thanks. It’s always a big team and right from the team at Rocket Lab to all of the shareholders, a huge thanks to everyone, and I hope we make everybody proud.

**Host:** I'm sure you will, Peter keep going, and let’s get together at the Neutron launch.

**Peter Beck (4:53):** Thanks. Shouldn’t have sold your stock though!

**All:** *laughs*
