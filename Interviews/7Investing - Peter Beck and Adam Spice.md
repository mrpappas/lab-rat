**Interviewer (Simon Erickson):** Hello everyone and welcome to today's episode of our Seven Investing program. I'm Seven Investing founder and CEO Simon Erickson, joined by my colleague Steve Symington. We're excited to welcome several executives from Rocket Lab to our show today: CEO and Founder Peter Beck and Chief Financial Officer Adam Spice. 

*Note: Rocket Lab is now a publicly traded company with the ticker RKLB.*

### The Evolving Space Economy

**Interviewer:** How do you see the space economy developing? We hear about this being a trillion-dollar industry developing right now. You're someone who lives this every single day. What are some of the biggest opportunities you see?

**Peter Beck:** We're at a pivotal time in the industry. When I was growing up, I thought I'd missed the heyday of space exploration, but I was wrong. This is truly the era to be in the space business. We're experiencing a significant shift from government-dominated programs to commercial enterprises taking control.

The industry is transforming, with private and public companies now taking advantage of numerous opportunities in space. What's particularly exciting is how commercial entities are now driving innovation and creating value in ways we've never seen before.

### Emerging Fields and Opportunities

**Interviewer:** Are there certain fields you think are going to grow at an outsized rate?

**Peter Beck:** Perhaps the most exciting aspect is that the largest thing to be done in space hasn't even been thought of yet. However, current promising areas include:

- Communications
- Earth observation
- Satellite technologies

The real advantage comes from companies like Rocket Lab that are integrating multiple aspects of space technology - from launch capabilities to spacecraft building and application development. This approach allows us to create opportunities at a cost and frequency never before possible.

### Launch Strategies: Rideshare vs. Dedicated Launches

**Interviewer:** Can you explain the advantages and costs of rideshare and dedicated launches, and how customer preferences are shifting?

**Peter Beck:** Think of it like transportation. If you need to get to a specific destination, sharing a ride only works if it gets you exactly where you need to go. In space, each satellite often requires a very specific orbit for its commercial viability.

- **Rideshare:** Sharing a large rocket, which can be cost-effective but less precise
- **Dedicated Launches:** A vehicle that takes you precisely where you need to go

Most of our customers have very specific orbital requirements that can't be met by simply "sharing the bus." Different applications - whether earth observation, communications, or other technologies - require unique orbital parameters.

### Neutron Rocket and Business Strategy

**Interviewer:** What's the impact of the Neutron rockets on Rocket Lab's future?

**Adam Spice:** Neutron is a strategic extension of our overall approach. While Electron has been phenomenal for bespoke operations and testing new technologies, Neutron allows us to deploy larger satellite constellations.

Our strategy isn't just about being a launch company. We're building a comprehensive space ecosystem that includes:
- Satellite components
- Satellite buses
- Launch vehicles
- Orbital services

### Industry Consolidation and Future Vision

**Peter Beck:** We believe the largest space companies of 2030 will look like Rocket Lab - combining launch capabilities, spacecraft manufacturing, and application services. The industry is characterized by many small operators, and consolidation is key to bringing scale and efficiency.

**Adam Spice:** What's unique about our approach is the multiple ways we can "play at the table" - whether it's launching, building components, or providing orbital services.

### Exciting Future Missions

**Interviewer:** What are you most excited about in the coming years?

**Peter Beck:** We have several exciting missions, including:
- A NASA mission to the moon
- Missions orbiting Mars
- A private mission to Venus, which could help answer the fundamental question: Are we alone in the solar system?

The development of Neutron rocket is particularly exciting. As Beck notes, most people are lucky to design one rocket in their lifetime. We're leveraging all our previous learnings to create something that looks more like 2050 technology than 2021.

### Closing Thoughts

**Interviewer:** We're excited to see where Rocket Lab goes, both for science enthusiasts and investors.

**Peter Beck and Adam Spice:** Thank you for the opportunity to share our story.
