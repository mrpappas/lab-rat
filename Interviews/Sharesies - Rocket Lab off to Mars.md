## üéôÔ∏è Transcript

### Introduction

**Leighton Roberts:** Hi there, welcome to Shares Lunch. My name is Leighton Roberts, I'm the co-founder and co-COO at Sharesies. We've got a really exciting episode for you today because I'm on site in Auckland at Rocket Lab with Sir Peter Beck. But as always, before we get started, here's some important information:

*[Disclaimer: Investing involves risk. You might lose the money you start with. We recommend talking to a licensed financial adviser. We also recommend reading product disclosure documents before deciding to invest. Everything you're about to see and hear is current at the time of recording.]*

Well, thanks so much for joining us again, Peter.

**Peter Beck:** Was a pleasure, fantastic to be here on in your space as well. It's probably the coolest place that I've ever filmed a podcast, that's for sure.

**Leighton:** Firstly though, it's the first time we've spoken to you as Sir Peter Beck, so how does that feel, and has there been the official ceremony yet? You had the sword on the shoulder?

**Peter Beck:** No, that's to come. Yeah, very unusual, quite odd. I mean, I'm just a southern boy trying to build some rockets. So it's very odd.

**Leighton:** Congratulations, and it's great to have someone in our entrepreneurial community, and particularly with the profile. Just doing these podcasts as well over the last couple of days, I've been watching a bunch and I see how many you've been doing with some quite random people in the retail network. Is that a real focus of yours or something you're really quite deliberate about?

**Peter Beck:** Yeah, I mean, we have a wide investor base, and we have a reasonable size retail base as well. So we do a lot of interviews with analysts and your normal kind of Wall Street folks, but I think it's important to talk to all investors.

### Recent Financial Performance

**Leighton:** Fantastic. So you've just had the biggest quarter in company history, Q2 2024. Can you give us a little bit of an outline of those earnings?

**Peter Beck:** So I mean, I'll convert it on the flight to New Zealand dollars, being a US entity, but about 170 million New Zealand dollar quarter, which as you point out is our biggest quarter to date. That represents, on a year-to-date kind of basis, a 71% year-over-year increase in revenue, which we're very happy about, and about a 15% increase quarter on quarter. Really good, solid earnings and great to tick over the 100 million USD mark per quarter.

**Leighton:** Fantastic, some really big numbers there. What's driving that year-on-year growth primarily?

**Peter Beck:** It's across all sectors. It's not just launch a standout or Space Systems a standout, it's everything really. Our backlog is also increased, and we're sitting at round about 1.6 billion NZD in backlog. The majority of that backlog sits in our Space Systems division, but both launch and Space Systems has just been growing really, really strongly.

**Leighton:** Great, and then the other one I noted was certainly that gap between the revenue and the loss number starting to get much closer. Is that a focus, and what's the sort of plan and trajectory from there?

**Peter Beck:** That'll move around because obviously we're investing a tremendous amount in Neutron. I mean, Neutron is a large rocket, and it is the big consumer of cash for the business. Absent that, then the business looks very profitable. But we're strategically investing in that for the future.

What we're trying to build here is an end-to-end space company, and what that really means is customers can come to us or governments can come to us, and we just provide the entire solution.

### End-to-End Space Company Strategy

**Leighton:** Nice. Well, that sort of brings me nicely into the question because the earnings report did focus a bit on that. Interesting how that looks, particularly the data and services and stuff, and how imminent that strategy is for Rocket Lab to be moving into that.

**Peter Beck:** I think if you look at all of the large space companies of the future, they're not going to look like a launch company, they're not going to look like a satellite company, they're going to look like an infrastructure company. We are accelerating as fast as we can to get to that point.

Really, the last piece in that puzzle for us is Neutron. Having a multi-ton capability to lift to orbit is really the only piece of the puzzle that's missing.

**Leighton:** And multi-ton, how many tons are we talking?

**Peter Beck:** That's going to be 13 tons.

**Leighton:** Right, and it's always good to put that in context. Electron, your current rocket, lifts 320 kgs, so you're lifting 13,000 kgs.

**Peter Beck:** And I'm looking at those out behind us, and they're still very big. It's huge, it's absolutely huge. In fact, we just announced today and put out some details of our large automatic fiber placement machine, which is a technical way of saying like the world's biggest carbon composite 3D printer. This massive 75-ton machine that makes the tanks.

**Leighton:** Incredible. And that's that you mentioned is going to be the competitor for the Falcon, the SpaceX?

**Peter Beck:** So I mean, there is unashamedly a kind of monopoly in medium launch right now. Our friends over at SpaceX have done very well with the Falcon 9, but there does need to be some balance restored in that market with a competitor. So that's the intention with Neutron.

### Neutron Development Status

**Leighton:** Great. So I mean, where are we at with Neutron then? It was, I think, originally targeted for the end of this year, now into 2025. Where's the progress going on that?

**Peter Beck:** So I mean, we always caveat any launch with "it's a rocket program." I think if you looked at some of the earnings and the development timelines of our vehicles, they're crazy short compared to any other launch vehicle. 

Electron was brought to market from announcement in like 2.8 years. Contrast that with more traditional programs, and they're measured in 8 to 10 years or more. So Neutron is on task to be delivered in sort of 4.5 years, which is faster than anybody's ever delivered a medium launch vehicle.

So the plan is to try and get this to the pad by middle of next year and get the first one away. But it is a rocket program, and there's just a huge amount of things that all have to come together.

**Leighton:** And just on that, coming back to that competitor space, the sort of cost per kilo ‚Äì still on track for that as well?

**Peter Beck:** Cost per kilo is a lovely metric that everybody can understand, but it's absolutely useless because nobody ever buys a rocket on a cost per kilo basis. Like those Electrons behind us ‚Äì a customer will come to us, and one customer might have a 100 kg payload, one customer might have a 250 kg payload. The price is no different. You buy the rocket at the fixed price of buying the rocket.

So a cost per kilo metric is a nice metric that's easily consumable, but it's not how rockets are sold. But nevertheless, on a cost per kilogram basis, yes, of course it's competitive with the other options out there.

### Revenue Streams

**Leighton:** Great. So between now and Neutron, the Electron remains the main revenue stream for the launch?

**Peter Beck:** It does. So Space Systems accounts for over two-thirds of the revenue for the company, but for launch, Electron remains.

**Leighton:** Can you break down some of those other revenue streams just quickly, that two-thirds?

**Peter Beck:** We don't typically break down into various categories of Space Systems, but it's spread across our components businesses. We sell a tremendous amount of components into other people's platforms. In fact, last year, 38% of everything that went to orbit had a Rocket Lab logo on it globally.

So whether it's a reaction wheel or a solar panel, we sell a lot of those components. And then spacecraft as well ‚Äì we have over 45 spacecraft in backlog, representing over $700 million US of revenue in the future. We cover a wide spectrum of spacecraft.

**Leighton:** So you collect the majority of cash on that, so 90% I think before launch?

**Peter Beck:** On the launch business model, everybody always focuses on how many launches did you get off in the quarter, which is a good metric to track, but actually from a cash collection standpoint, it's totally irrelevant.

As you point out, when it comes to launch day, we have collected 90% of all of the contract value. Our business model with Electron is our customers fly with us because we can tailor the mission and we can tailor the timelines.

It's not uncommon for a customer to delay a launch because their spacecraft isn't ready or they want to optimize their orbital or those kinds of things. And of course, that can play havoc with our quarters because it shifts a launch from one quarter to the other.

What we're trying to explain to people is don't get too worried ‚Äì it doesn't actually matter because we would have probably collected up to 90% of the cash collections against that contract. The contracts never go away, they just sort of move around in the quarters, and that's actually our value proposition. That's why people come fly with us.

So on one side of the equation, we don't want to be penalized by the street for moving a thing between quarters because that's actually their business model.

**Leighton:** And I mean, what happens if something goes wrong with the launch? You've already collected 90%...

**Peter Beck:** That is the way launch contracts are written. Once we intentionally ignite the engines, that is 100% of the contract complete, generally. Occasionally there is some extra things on the contract, but that's the vast majority of all launch contracts. On intentional ignition, your service is complete.

### Rocket Insurance

**Leighton:** I mentioned that I was chilling with you to my Uber driver yesterday when I was driving to the airport, and one of his questions for you through me was how you ensure rockets, which is sort of quite relevant after that. I said I'm not sure if there's many insurance companies lining up, but I said if I got the opportunity, I'd ask you.

**Peter Beck:** Absolutely, there is a whole insurance market. Customers ensure their spacecraft for the replacement of their spacecraft. They can ensure them for the replacement of the spacecraft and another launch. They can even ensure them for those things plus, if it does blow up, a loss in revenue in the future.

There was a quite famous insurance claim a few years ago from, I think it was a UAE satellite where it was lost in a launch failure, and they made an insurance claim for the future generation of the revenue off that spacecraft. It was the largest insurance claim in the space industry's history. Insurance got a lot more expensive after that one. But no, there's a vibrant insurance market for it.

**Leighton:** I'm trying to think if there's many other businesses where revenue or contract is delivered at ignite point. That's quite unique, I think, but makes complete sense.

**Peter Beck:** This is the reality of the business. It's extraordinarily difficult, and that is just the nature of the business.

### State of the Space Industry

**Leighton:** Great. Maybe just the overall, be really interesting in your view on the overall health of the space industry at the moment. There's been a huge amount of change. We were just talking about the documentary "Wild Wild Space" which was fantastic for Rocket Lab, I thought. So what's your feeling of the space industry at the moment and where it's heading?

**Peter Beck:** The space industry is generally relatively insulated from macroeconomic things, in a general sense, only because a lot of the space programs or the space infrastructure programs are measured in five or more years of deployment.

So if you're going to put a constellation of Earth observation spacecraft on orbit, it could be something like a 5 to 7 year timeline. So you can have a whole economic cycle during that, and generally these programs are funded for that duration. In some respects, on the large programs, they're relatively insulated from any kind of major environmental or economic things.

Sometimes some really perverse things happen. I think there was a bit of a boom in the space industry during some of the other downturns simply because there's a whole lot of unemployed people at home watching TV, and all their TV was coming through satellite. So they had to launch a whole lot more satellites to suffice that demand.

But I would say that definitely from an entrepreneurial standpoint, the space industry was at its frothiest in sort of 2020-2021. Like there was crazy stuff done and large amounts of capital put at work into some pretty suspect business models.

You're seeing that kind of thrash out now, and you're seeing who are the real people in this industry and who are the less real people in this industry. Perhaps a little bit of consolidation happening after that.

**Leighton:** Well, that consolidation creates opportunities too.

**Peter Beck:** For us, we were able to pick up a competitor, Virgin Orbit, that failed, and we're able to pick up all of their assets for 16 cents on the dollar, which are now hard at work producing Neutron engines.

**Leighton:** Topical at the moment, but the Boeing situation that's happening currently ‚Äì astronauts are stuck on the International Space Station due to some technical issues. I was just wondering if you had any thoughts or views on that happening?

**Peter Beck:** I think it highlights the fact that it's always good to have two alternatives. To our point with Neutron as well, it's like you can't have one dominant or just one primary access to space. You need multiple. The space industry is super hard ‚Äì this is not easy stuff. I think it really speaks to the importance of having more than one supplier.

### Mars Mission and Spacecraft Development

**Leighton:** You recently built two spacecraft heading to Mars, the blue and gold. Is there any more developments in that space?

**Peter Beck:** They're actually shipping as we speak to head to Cape Canaveral to be launched. Super exciting mission ‚Äì it's not very often you get to work on a planetary mission. It's just super cool for the team.

I would say the unique thing about that is that typically, if you look at the logos that are orbiting Mars right now, they're all the logos that you would expect from the very large defense and space primes. When those two spacecraft from Rocket Lab arrive, 20% of everything orbiting Mars will have a Rocket Lab logo on it, and that's cool in its own right.

But the thing is that generally those programs have a billion-dollar price tag attached to it and a decade of time attached to it. We built two spacecraft in three and a half years for tens of millions of dollars. That to me is a bigger accomplishment than actually even going to Mars.

Why that's important is that is incredibly disruptive to the space industry, incredibly disruptive to interplanetary signs. I think people are looking at that and thinking, well, if you can go to Mars for some tens of millions of dollars, then that totally changes the paradigm of interplanetary research and interplanetary work.

**Leighton:** How long's the journey there?

**Peter Beck:** It's a multi-year mission. The journey to get to Mars is quite long. There's a transit window to Mars that happens every couple of years, so that ends in sort of the end of September or thereabouts. Then they spend a long time in a cruise state.

The spacecraft themselves have a tremendous amount of propulsion on board. The mission is very, very difficult. We don't just put the spacecraft asleep for a couple of years and arrive at Mars. There's active maneuvering all the way. And then when they get there, we have to capture Mars's gravitational field and go into orbit. Once we're in orbit, we have to do a whole bunch of maneuvers for the science. Very difficult mission, not a simple affair.

**Leighton:** And that maneuvering is still largely human-driven? It's sort of not set beforehand?

**Peter Beck:** There's certainly nobody on a joystick because there's like a 20-minute delay, but there are pre-programmed maneuvers.

### Venus Life-Finding Mission

**Leighton:** Speaking on interplanetary, a couple of years ago, maybe, I think you first sort of mentioned the idea of finding aliens on Venus. Any progress there or thoughts?

**Peter Beck:** That is a nights and weekends kind of philanthropic project. Nobody's paying for that. So we just kind of take all bits and put them together and do stuff in nights and weekends.

The probe is coming on really well. The probe manufacturing is almost complete, the instrument manufacturing is complete. We're just waiting for the right time to get that away. We're too busy with real work right now.

### SpaceX in Australia and Rocket Design

**Leighton:** What a cool sideline project. A bit closer to home, there's been some speculation I've been reading about on the internet that SpaceX might end up with a spot in Australia. I don't know how true that is, but if that would happen, does that impact Rocket Lab in any way?

**Peter Beck:** They're going to need spots all around the world because with the fully reusable orbital kind of concept, you're in orbit and the Earth is processing underneath you. So you can't just take off and land back where you started because the Earth's processed and you're in a different spot now.

So they're going to have to land in different countries, and then once you land in Australia, you have to ship the vehicle back to the United States and all the rest of it.

I guess some of that is what drove us. When you look at the architecture of Neutron, there's kind of two schools here ‚Äì fully reusable or largely reusable. If you look at a rocket, the first stage represents 70% of all of the cost of the rocket traditionally. Now if you can make that 70% reusable, then the expendable upper stage equation from a business standpoint makes great sense. That's what we've really focused on.

If you look at the upper stage of Neutron, it's a giant carbon composite tank, but it's wafer-thin. I mean, that whole tank, it's 5m in diameter, 5m tall, weighs the same as a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. So if it doesn't weigh much, you're not using much material, and it doesn't cost much.

If you look at the architecture of Neutron, it is a giant outsized first stage for a tiny little second stage. But the first stage is the bit that we keep back and we keep reusing again and again. So the economics become a little bit blurry when you've got to ship giant rockets all around the world. Who knows what they end up turning out to be, but we are for sure certain in the economics of the Neutron approach anyway.

### Wild Wild Space Documentary

**Leighton:** Just going to move into the "Wild Wild Space" movie that we touched on before. I'm not sure if you're at the point of sick of hearing it yet or not, but like I said, it did teach me a lot. I think Rocket Lab came out really glowing, as you do in it. I'm just interested if there's any takeaways for you in that process or anything that you learned in the film that came out?

**Peter Beck:** I was a reluctant participant in that whole thing. Compared to the access that others gave the documentary makers, we didn't provide as much access. It wasn't as critical for us as perhaps others. But I think what you see on the documentary is what it is. That's how we operate, and we take what we do very seriously.

What I think it highlights is that in the space industry, there is a tremendous number of folks trying to do great stuff. One great thing about the space industry is you can have a very grand idea, and you can go and raise a lot of money. That was a wonderful thing about the space industry, but it's also kind of the downside of the space industry because if you're a good salesman with a way-out idea, you can go and raise some money and then quickly literally set fire to it all.

A lot of people in the space industry have a cool idea and then try and build a business around a cool idea. That's just never been our approach. We look for honest-to-God real holes in the market that we can plug and then build a product to meet those.

As we were talking before, like 2020-2021, there was peak frothiness within the industry, and cubic dollars got put at work ‚Äì and cubic dollars got lost. That's kind of part of the challenge for us. A lot of investors put a lot of money into the space industry, and it wasn't successful.

Adam Spice, my CFO, and I often joke together, "We've got the best house in a really bad neighborhood," because everybody burned their house down, and there's dead cars on the lawn. But the markets are very efficient, and in time these things kind of correct. But certainly, the space industry in that frothy period did lose a lot of capital.

### Business Strategy Evolution

**Leighton:** I was thinking while you were talking there because one of the quotes I think you made early on in that documentary was about needing to understand what the business is behind it ‚Äì it's not just building rockets, it's people. I'm wondering at what point in your journey you started to observe some of those business opportunities and how you continue to evolve that thinking?

**Peter Beck:** Look, we're hustlers, so we're always looking for the next opportunity that we think we can either disrupt or displace or compete with. You've seen we're not a static company. We brought the Electron product to market, and it is the preeminent leader in small launch. Electron alone accounts for 64% of all United States launch, third most frequently launched rocket in the world now. So market opportunity plugged it.

Likewise with Space Systems, we saw a real opportunity there to scale and provide different alternatives. We bought a whole bunch of businesses and then scaled the heck out of them. As we talked about before, now we're a big supplier there.

And then same with Neutron ‚Äì there is a huge launch demand that's not been met by one provider. You just can't have one provider. So we made the big call, and it is a big call, to go and invest in Neutron.

But the one thing that I would say is that we're all kind of engineers here, so we're all pretty conservative folks. You'll never see Rocket Lab kind of push all the chips into the center of the table on one particular idea or opportunity. We're always very methodical on the way that we build the business.

**Leighton:** At what point, like 10 years or a decade ago, did you realize that it would be almost an infrastructure play that you were building, or how's that evolved?

**Peter Beck:** We're often asked this question: "Rocket Lab pivoted into building satellites as well as rockets." I'm like, no, we never pivoted. The second Electron rocket that we ever launched, on the kick stage, which is the top of the rocket that goes into orbit, had recesses all around that kick stage for solar panels to turn that into a satellite. That was on flight two.

But once again, going back to the point, I'm never going to push all the chips into the center. We needed to establish Electron as a market leader first, and I like to finish one thing before I start the next.

Once Electron was kind of dialed in, then we announced our Space Systems program and started to grow that. Then when the right time to bring Neutron into the mix, we did that as well. So once Space Systems is established and everything, we bring Neutron into the mix.

**Leighton:** It's such a familiar entrepreneurial sort of tale ‚Äì that entrepreneurial drift where that comes in. We've got a case at Sharesies at the moment as well. We're sort of doing a lot more in the B2B space, and one of the common questions is, "Are you pivoting into businesses more?" It's like, no ‚Äì if you rewind five years ago to our first pitch decks, this was on there. That wasn't the bit that was captured in the story.

**Peter Beck:** You'll find that all companies have a large vision, and you just have to keep working towards that vision. Sometimes the direction changes a bit or how you get there, but there is always a grander goal.

### Memorable Launches

**Leighton:** One of the other things that the documentary showcased was the pressure around that launch, and I think you said it was your least favorite time. But I was wondering if there's any particularly enjoyable ones that you have reflected on or particularly challenging ones?

**Peter Beck:** For me personally, one of the most satisfying ones was a first flight for NASA. Before I started Rocket Lab, my plan at school was always to go and work for NASA ‚Äì that was the goal. I quickly found out that a foreign national with no university degree is very challenging to go and work for NASA.

Not to be outdone with that, the easiest solution was just to go and start Rocket Lab. Launching, I think it was flight four, a dedicated group of payloads for NASA just felt full circle.

Of course, in the heat of the moment, you're never thinking any of this, but it's often the drive home after a successful launch, you go, "Huh, that actually happened and that was super cool."

### The Launch Countdown

**Leighton:** That's one of the things I have to ask ‚Äì how relevant is the countdown these days? It seems like it's been in movies forever, it's still happening in all of them, but it just seems to me that surely there's a computer better placed, but not for the overall drama of it.

**Peter Beck:** The computer actually takes control of not only the launch vehicle but also the launch site and all the infrastructure at T-minus 10 minutes. When we enter auto sequence, that's when we hand over control to the computer, and the rocket is also controlling the ground systems. We can interrupt that auto sequence, but from that point onwards until the spacecraft is deployed, it's all on the rocket.

But the countdown is important because you want to know when stuff is supposed to happen and that it's going to happen. It'd be pretty weird to just sort of sit there and just watch a rocket launch without any kind of notice.

**Leighton:** I absolutely love watching that. Just watching that thing, just the stress and those moments as you're about to ignite something that could literally blow up.

**Peter Beck:** It is a bizarre thing to say, but for the first few launches, I was doing the 10 count ‚Äì I was doing the final countdown. There's so much going on, and you're concentrating so much that it's actually really hard to count backwards. You wouldn't think it, but you're sitting there, and you have to actually go in your head, "Oh well, seven is before eight," and there's so much going on that you'd think that would be a super easy task, but actually, it's more difficult than you think.

### Hiring Without a Degree

**Leighton:** You mentioned that you didn't have the degree and that stuff. What's the plausibility of someone being able to work at Rocket Lab, for example, without having that degree and getting a job here now?

**Peter Beck:** 100%. You get a CV, and they all look the same. I don't know who's telling which careers advisor or university telling people to write CVs, but they all look the same, and it's impossible to distinguish the kind of Rocket Lab person that we like.

So the first question we ask is, "Okay, this is great, put it to one side, tell me what you actually do in your spare time, tell me what you've built." Those are the people that we actually want.

The people that do well here are people who, in an engineering sense, are born engineers. So they'll go to university, they'll do an engineering degree or not, but then after that, they'll go home and they'll be working on their car or they'll be building a quadcopter, or their whole life revolves around engineering. Those are the people that you really want.

### Risk Taking and Personal Ventures

**Leighton:** I remember maybe in an earlier podcast, you mentioned that you would never go into space yourself, you don't see that as a thing. But I have noticed on another YouTube thing I was watching where you did used to ride your early rockets. Is it just the space factor, or has your risk appetite changed in general?

**Peter Beck:** I've got a fairly healthy risk appetite. It's just one of those things that the more you know about something, the more you realize you don't know. I have all of the engineering insight, but in that sense, none of the courage to climb on board a rocket because I understand all of the things that have to go right too well.

I have tremendous admiration for astronauts because a lot of those guys are engineers as well, and they have a full understanding as well. I think it just takes a special kind of person to do that.

Maybe if I'm kind of old and all your kids are grown up, but if you've actually got responsibilities to people and to other things, I think it's a pretty tough thing to do to take that level of risk.

**Leighton:** You mentioned the healthy appetite for risk. Where is that line then? What are the things that you like doing?

**Peter Beck:** I think I'm paid to take a relatively large amount of risk and then mitigate it to an extreme level such that it doesn't occur. That's basically the definition of a rocket CEO. Happy to take risk, but you can't take risk unless you fully understand all the consequences and how you mitigate them.

I think there's a big difference between perceived risk and actual risk. You brought up the rocket bike ‚Äì someone standing on the outside looking at a rocket bike probably looks very, very risky. But the actual risk of that is the particular engine on that was incredibly robust. The chances of that thing detonating were almost zero. The stability of the vehicle was really, really solid, and I had heaps of safety gear on. Worst case scenario: probably skid along the ground, no big deal.

So the difference there is, yes, there is actual risk if you didn't mitigate it through making things safe, and there's a lot of perceived risk that isn't actually even there.

### Investment Strategy

**Leighton:** Just maybe outside of Rocket Lab, I know you do invest in a few companies. What are the things that you're normally looking for when you're selecting companies?

**Peter Beck:** As being the CEO of a publicly traded company, you lose some of that entrepreneurial ability. So I need to get my hit, and I get my hit through supporting other early-stage companies. I sit on an investment committee for Outset and invest in companies as you point out.

I guess the things that I'm invested in are all things that I think could be billion-dollar entities in New Zealand ‚Äì those are the things that I get really excited about. I've always viewed that it's the same amount of work to build a $10 million company as a $10 billion company, so why would you bother building a $10 million company?

There's nothing the matter with a $10 million company, it's great, there's lots of those, and it's super important. But for me, if I'm going to use my time on this planet, I want to have the maximum impact possible. So those are the companies that I look to support and help in New Zealand, and there's a bunch of those, which is super exciting.
