>[!Success] Mission Success

>[!summary]
The “Owl Night Long” mission successfully lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand and deployed a [[./Synspective#🛰️ Space Systems|StriX-3]] satellite to orbit. 
>
Rocket Lab has been the exclusive launch provider for [[./Synspective|Synspective]] to date and the “Owl Night Long” mission was our fourth launch for the constellation operator following launches in 2020 and 2022:
>
>- The Owl's Night Begins: Launched December 2020

Synspective is a satellite data solutions provider with its own constellation of SAR satellites. [[./📦 Payload Types#Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)|Synthetic Aperture Rader (SAR)]] is an active system that transmits microwave pulses toward the Earth's surface and receives the reflected signals to create an image of the target area. Unlike other imaging technologies, SAR can penetrate clouds and other atmospheric conditions, enabling it to collect data day or night with frequent revisit rates.
